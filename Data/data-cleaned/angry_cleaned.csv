1262,annoyed,They tried to make out I was bad at my job thats the last time Ill give somebody a heads up at my own expense again
1263,annoyed,I sure did thankfully Ive been there a lot longer so they know me well enough
1264,annoyed,It did but it could have ended very badly for me or even have resulted in me losing my job
1274,disgusted,I stand behind him Compared to the rest of the world we are to easy on illegal immigrants and this is coming from a Mexican American 
1275,disgusted,How so because I want everyone in this place to be safe You need to google immigration in other parts of the world and you will realize how awesome it is here
1276,disgusted,Its sad that you have such a small mind

1354,annoyed,Video games How did you know
1515,disgusted,I SO agree I would not want to live like that And its one thing if theyre only affecting themselves  but when its aimed at others  the worst

1719,annoyed,Is it ok
1720,annoyed,I do not like salesman

1745,annoyed,I do like a good sandwich thou But I eat slow

1785,disgusted,Is it for religious reasons
1786,disgusted,Thats what my husband and I think  I mean even when they were babies and would run 103 fever she wouldnt take them  I just do not understand that at all  they are both grown now but shes pretty uninvolved with either of them
1861,disgusted,I watched a movie based off a true story on that once It was truely a sad story for the little girl and her parents
1862,disgusted,It was a korean movie Dont recall the name
1863,disgusted,What movie was it
1876,angry,Im glad you and your husband communicate enough to know that
1877,angry,What do you say to your kids to deal with it
1878,angry,Its frustrating though never knowing how shes going to interpret something and then share it with others  Some of the things shes told our kids have been just horrible
1882,angry,Wow What a mature teacher
1883,angry,Was the fire related to the incident or did she get in trouble for something else
1884,angry,Yeah she eventually was fired a year later but it still makes me angry to think about it
1927,angry,I am sorry kids can be mean
1928,angry,Some people do not need to be in charge when it comes to school they are truly worthless sometimes
1929,angry,Yes they can  But I blame the parents also these kids bullied her to the point that I had to have her removed from that class  the principles wouldnt even do anything

2313,annoyed,Awe I am sorry What made it tough
2314,annoyed,I hate when bosses are like that Is he normally like that If so I would sit him down and talk to him and tell him how his actions are affecting you
2315,annoyed,My boss kept criticizing my work He kept bugging on me to an unbearable point
2325,angry,How terrible I bet your heart stopped in that moment
2326,angry,People seem to only care about themselves a lot
2327,angry,Yea it did I was so frustrated that someone could be so careless
2435,angry,Sure my dad is a Cowboys fan He misses the days of Troy Aikman and Emmett Smith
2436,angry,Yeah I remember as a boy watching those guys They creamed Buffalo in the Super Bowl
2437,angry,I agree Emmett Smith is an awesome runningback  Dez Bryant just ran his mouth too much and was too emotional  Its a shame and hes still unemployed  How upsetting  Troy Aikman was a great quarterback and a great commentator
2438,angry,I agree they were some good games between the fills and cowboys
2439,angry,Road rage is a problem I deal with too  I have adult add and tend to be impulsive and am horrible at socializing  Im glad your alright and I dont blame you for getting stressed out by that
2440,angry,I cant believe she didnt at least apologize or wave sorry  Thats why cell phones are horrible and can cause accidents  Im glad your ok
2441,angry,Yeah and then when I finally got around her I saw she was yakking on her cell phone completely oblivious to the world around her So annoying
2456,disgusted,i think you have the same attitude like me i really feel pissed off
2457,disgusted,the best way is to tame it well so that it will have good manners
2458,disgusted,Yea I hate having to pick it up afterwards
2537,annoyed,That happens to me all the time because I drive a large van with a lot of extras  It is such a pain
2538,annoyed,Maybe we both need to buy one of those chargers that you can keep in your car so you dont have to ask for a jump
2539,annoyed,Yea it makes me want to just walk back inside and go back to sleep and ignore everything
2555,angry,That is a disgrace Some people just do not get it
2556,angry,That is understandable When did this incident occur
2557,angry,I feel like punching him in the face He was so rude and stupid 
2809,angry,I bet you wore shoes on the street for a while
2810,angry,Thats too bad
2811,angry,Aye I did it because I lost a 500 bet 
2833,angry,Did your girlfriend cheat on you 
2834,angry,But most people are still faithful in their relationship 
2835,angry,yes a long time ago she did
2843,annoyed,Oh thats frustrating have you told them how you felt
2844,annoyed,Oh thats too bad I wonder if you could find a way to politely say something so you can focus
2845,annoyed,No I am too shy to do that This coworker start endless conversation and keep talking and talking It is delaying me in work
2912,angry,Oh no can you wash it
2913,angry,That is worrying you might have to throw it out
2914,angry,Yes but I can never get the smell out
2915,angry,I probably will throw it out
2919,angry,Wow that cat must have loved that shoe he wanted it
2920,angry,That is true especially when you dont give them attention
2921,angry,Yea they seem to know what you care about and try and ruin it
2933,disgusted,Hahahaha what was she thinking 
2934,disgusted,Its really annoying right
2935,disgusted,A lot of those people are trashy or druggies really sickening to be around
2949,annoyed,do what
2950,annoyed,Yeah they give up
2951,annoyed,Some people dont have any reason of ignoring calls
2975,angry,Wow did he forget your address
2976,angry,Wow that is really nice
2977,angry,No Im pretty sure they have something against me because both my neighbors get their mail
2982,disgusted,this is so funnyi didnt hear it anywhere
2983,disgusted,oh reallyits  sounds terrible
2984,disgusted,I was horrified I do not want anything from him again just the thought of the bacteria freaks me out
2985,disgusted,It totally is
2999,annoyed,I hate when my cat used to do that Would this happen often
3000,annoyed,Cats can really be such strange pets sometimes I swear they live off of our momentary hatred for them
3001,annoyed,Not really but he just did it for the fun of it or something
3031,annoyed,That must be really annoying What were they late to this time
3032,annoyed,4 hours late Totally unacceptable But hey at least you live near a beach
3033,annoyed,Just an evening beach plan They were nearly 4 hours late this time
3073,annoyed,Thats horrible I mean if you have a job at least make the effort to get there on time
3074,annoyed,Sorry to hear that I guess your boss must have been feeling the same as you were about the nanny
3075,annoyed,Exactly The worst part is that I got into so much trouble with my boss and we almost lost the client
3076,annoyed,Yes I guess he was but the difference is I was calling in and updating them on where I was I had to call her and she had the nerve to have an attitude too
3163,disgusted,Honestlythats very true
3164,disgusted,Thats the way he iscan u imagineso ungodly show
3165,disgusted,Such abhorrent arrogance and ungodly show on his part

3198,angry,Like sweet namespampering
3221,angry,Thats horrible how could they get it wrong
3222,angry,They should pay you for the time you spend on sorting it out
3223,angry,I dont now but I hate when they do that now I have to call or write and lose a ton of time solving it
3236,angry,some friend Maybe hes insecure and thought you or her were flirting
3237,angry,well then he shouldnt have jumped to conclusions Things arent always what they seem
3238,angry,yes but were just planning  a surprise birthday party for my friend
3249,annoyed,I dont think you are alone there What do you find so irritating about it
3250,annoyed,I know what you mean All the people seem to be the same types  fame hungry narcissists
3251,annoyed,Well its supposed to be reality but seems so fake
3262,annoyed,I absolutely feel the same way It is a rare trait but there are few people who do better on tasks on their own than as group task

3684,angry,we were just arguing whether its a goal or not while playing soccer We laughed it off with beer at the end though
3705,disgusted,I hate that It makes it really hard to want to go home
3706,disgusted,That would be good for you Maybe you will get some good neighbors then
3707,disgusted,We share a stairwell and they always leave trash on it The always get notices about rent so maybe they will be evicted soon
3708,disgusted,I hope so Or none

3715,annoyed,He couldnt handle it I feel bad for him
3727,disgusted,Nice did you become sort of a nature girl after that experience Or were you just traumatized haha
3728,disgusted,Thats pretty cool  So Im guessing youre more of a city gal
3729,disgusted,No haha not traumatized but happy to move in to a real apartment once we had enough money saved haha 
3779,annoyed,Oh I know what you mean It is even worse when you ask for their manager and the manager gives you a major tude
3780,annoyed,Right They can go get a job as a garbage collector if they want to act that way
3781,annoyed,Their only job is to service the customer Why do they make it so hard I didnt force them to apply for that job Sheesh
3782,annoyed,They can even be nice though lol
3809,disgusted,Oh no I opened an expired can a long time ago I check everything twice now

3889,disgusted,Well my friend decided in the car with windows all open to throw up on me one night

3912,annoyed,Maybe a car dealership could help
3913,annoyed,I kept my cool with him but I am a little frustrated over it I have no idea how to clean it up
3946,annoyed,Wow What was taking so long
3947,annoyed,I bet you were annoyed Hopefully it didnt make you late to anywhere you needed to be
3948,annoyed,It was just a mob of people getting frappacinos I thought mine would be spoiled by the time I got it
3980,angry,Oh man That must have been nerve wrecking
3981,angry,were they on the phone
3982,angry,they were not paying attention 
4015,annoyed,Oh that can be annoying sometimes I hope theyre not too serious
4016,annoyed,Oh well that doesnt sound too bad I hope he gets some in return though
4017,annoyed,Nah theyre just stupid things like moving stuff around putting wacky sticky notes on your desk changing your desktop wallpaper etc
4049,annoyed,So did you go to her dinner or do what you had planned
4050,annoyed,I find that they dont respect you until you start telling them no
4051,annoyed,I went to the dinner and then left a little early to go out She wasnt happy but maybe next time she will plan better
4052,annoyed,Thats what I have found too She needs to realize I am an adult
4098,annoyed,That sucks 
4099,annoyed,My kids are taking a nap now The run this house lol

4303,annoyed,Their guests playing music from their car Sor rude
4304,annoyed,They just moved here I will let them know when I meet them officially I cant take it
4312,angry,That is a shame  I hear that is happening a lot in schools today

4398,annoyed,Wow thats absurd Of course its the ONE thats impotrant
4399,annoyed,Thats always so awful Its too bad it wasnt something you bought with a credit card and could just dispute it

4713,annoyed, I was returning an item at a store and the person in front of me had a whole cart of items to return and was taking forever

4809,annoyed,Its hard being a parent but i am sure you are doing it right 
4810,annoyed,Well he pays rent but he definitely uses up more resources than he pays for 
4811,annoyed,Well I try I moved to Alabama after the divorce and the kids hate it here
4817,annoyed,Oh wow sorry to hear that was really rude of her
4818,annoyed,Some people can take things so far I hate it when they do that
4819,annoyed,I am the type of person that gets what I have to buy and get out of the store 
4820,annoyed,that was very stupid of her  it seemed kind of racist to me
4821,annoyed,that store is notorious for rude shoppers though

4979,angry,Its an easy mistake to make were supposed to trust family you know
4980,angry,That he got out and he was unable to find him  Things are known to go missing when my brother in law is around  We should have known better
4994,disgusted,Oh very interesting Im not a fan of the owner either Why do you feel that way though
4995,disgusted,Thats a fair point But Lebron James is different and probably seeks to try to really control the team he is on so that can be difficult too
4996,disgusted,I think owners should be professional because everyone is watching  You treat your star like that how do you treat the little average joe on the team
5029,angry,I am sure you are that sounds bad
5030,angry,There are just bad people out there
5031,angry,Its awful How are people okay with being so cruel
5041,annoyed,I know exactly what you mean
5042,annoyed,It makes it hard to communicate though
5043,annoyed,I guess everyone feels like that to an extent it is unavoidable
5050,disgusted,WOW Why do people have to be violent ugh 
5051,disgusted,right me either its too bad but glad you are thinking right

5066,angry,Please dont care about those people Try to be true to yourself World will recognize you one day  
5067,angry,Exactly Youre right Ignore them 
5068,angry,That is so true People like that are not worth the time of day
5069,angry,Have you been married a long time

5302,disgusted,wow you might just have bad luck
5303,disgusted,i would just take an uber from now on if i were you
5304,disgusted,Yes  The first thing they said when they got out of their car was I dont have insurance
5305,disgusted,I believe I do because it was the third straight time someone has hit me without insurance
5358,disgusted,Did you pet try to eat it

8915,angry,It is these delicate balance of our natural body that makes us to be diligent for survival
8916,angry,Indeed Nature is very interesting and complex to interpret Survival is the only mechanism that drive us to have certain physical features
8917,angry,Thats actually a really interesting way to frame it We try hard to survive because we know how fragile we are as a species If we werent so fragile wed take it for granted Interesting perspective
8945,annoyed,Oh really Any ideas why
8946,annoyed,Maybe they like you
8947,annoyed,I dont know but I even have pictures of my cat and some Funko Pops at that desk and the one next to me is never used

8951,annoyed,Sometimes I have a hard time finding work to do or finding someone to work with It can drive me crazy
8974,angry,Thats not good Whats wrong
8975,angry,Oh man that would make me angry Is there anyone you can call and report them anonymously
8976,angry,Maybe you can sneak over and steal them
8977,angry,Well my neighbors dog just had puppies All of the dogs are really malnourished Its infuriating to see this happening and not knowing what to do
8978,angry,I think so but the animal shelter will kill them
8979,disgusted,oh no that would make me feel guilty Is he okay
8980,disgusted,is he allergic to that type of food If not you need to transition him slowly But thats funny lol
8981,disgusted,Hes perfectly find but man was it gross 
8982,disgusted,Im really not sure but hes definitely not having it anymore Almost made me puke when I saw his puke all over the house
9079,annoyed,Oh no  What does he do that is so annoying
9080,annoyed,It is nice that he wants to stay connected I guess
9081,annoyed,He just calls and talks about nothing
9110,annoyed,Tell me about it I got like 3 hours last night
9111,annoyed,Hey Girlfriends just need an ear some time 
9112,annoyed,dude same my girlfriend just loves to talk and talk and doesnt let me sleep It is exhausting I cant rest
9126,disgusted,I would cry very much
9127,disgusted,I would cry and cry for days
9128,disgusted,Yea I am usually terrified of rats so seeing a dead one is even worse
9182,disgusted,I would guess that if your survival mode you will do whatever you have to
9183,disgusted,I would like to think that I wouldnt but if it were that or die Id eat
9184,disgusted,I could never ever do it
9208,angry,Great  So you found out already that you got it or are you just confident
9209,angry,that is upsetting  I am sorry to hear that
9210,angry,Thats just it I didnt get it It went to someone that Im sure is less qualified It was quite upsetting
9214,annoyed,That can be upsetting Did they tell you why
9215,annoyed,Maybe its time to look for another job
9216,annoyed,No just the usual responses that dont offer useful feedback
9245,disgusted,I am with you  It is horrendous
9246,disgusted,I agree with you
9247,disgusted,I hope that the punishment they receive will be a warning for others
9383,annoyed,Thats a hard thing to deal with Do you think shes really hungry
9384,annoyed,Maybe her body clock is out of whack
9385,annoyed,No She just doesnt want to go to bed
9386,annoyed,She asked for some butter
9412,annoyed,Right now

9444,angry,Delete these messages lol
9452,angry,I hate that
9453,angry,People should be more considerate though
9454,angry,It was irrational as I know they arent doing it on purpose  but it made me really angry
9498,angry,I feel really sorry for you Will you be okay
9499,angry,I hope everything works out for you
9500,angry,I dont know its weird just sitting at home and knowing she isnt here
9501,angry,Well at least she is gone I couldnt stand to look at her
9518,annoyed,What about it is annoying Isnt it better for the dog
9519,annoyed,that does not seem safe for anyone Is there anything you can do about it
9520,annoyed,It probably is better for the dog But the owners arent always responsible Where I live they use them on the sidewalk and block off the whole area for other people walking
9527,disgusted,Why is that
9528,disgusted,I can understand that viewpoint Its a very complicated issue though
9529,disgusted,I cant see why tey would want to sever ties with Europe and become separate
9536,angry,Why is that
9537,angry,That IS annoying
9538,angry,I feel like I wasted a lot of time today because someone blocked my car after work and I couldnt leave
9539,angry,Yup it wasnt fun at all Oh well
9543,annoyed,Why not That doesnt sound fun
9544,annoyed,Im sorry the hear that maybe next time
9545,annoyed,Not at all fun We got into a huge argument about me using the car earlier and then he said my punishment was i cant go to the party
9546,annoyed,Absolutely What happened
9547,annoyed,Thats bad Did any charges get pressed
9548,annoyed,He lied about me assaulting him and it was just an argument really
9549,annoyed,Yes but he dropped the charges later on
9583,disgusted,Oh no what happened to the car
9584,disgusted,Wow that is so disgusting
9585,disgusted,It was filled with used diapers
9586,disgusted,I agree and it smelled horrible
9604,angry,That is unfortunate You must have really angry to have wasted your time
9605,angry,It has happened to me as well Its very annoying when it happens
9606,angry,U cant imagine 
9617,disgusted,What  Was that freezed to have stayed that long 
9618,disgusted,Uhmmnn  Thats awful  
9619,disgusted,It was out at room temperature I wanted to throw up
9640,angry,Am so sorry  how did you handle it
9641,angry,That can be tiresome I hope you had it all handled at the end
9642,angry,I am so upset about it I had to call all of the credit bureaus 
9656,angry,I am in the US Why does it make you so angry Ive never heard about
9657,angry,I think I will Im very curious now You think they would want to use their time more wisely
9658,angry,The politicians just spend the whole time shouting at each other and laughing at their own jokes Its pathetic You should youtube it
9659,angry,They get paid either way
9697,disgusted,That is a reason to be sad but also to be furious
9698,disgusted,All people are the sameI understand why you feel ver sad and I guess frustrated too
9699,disgusted,Thats right it makes me angry as well when someone is treated unfairly
9706,disgusted,That is pretty gross but it happens often
9707,disgusted,If you plan on having a kid it will happen
9708,disgusted,I was so grossed out by the sight of it
9712,angry,have they offered to buy you a replacement
9713,angry,Thats not a very good friend then accidents happen but you should own up to them  have you considered suing in small claims youd at least get your money back to get a new phone
9714,angry,No he ran away and is ignoring my messages I just feel like punching him
9723,annoyed,Have you talked to him about being a bit cleaner in general
9724,annoyed,Ah thats a tough situation Maybe some subtle hints would work best like leaving a deodorizer near his room
9725,annoyed,Good point and yes we both have asked him to tidy his room up some to help with the bad smells He works in a deli and does nothing when he gets home so talking to him did not work even though he agreed to try
9750,annoyed,How did you feel relieved or disappointed
9751,annoyed,Did they reschedule
9752,annoyed,I was very annoyed because I had prepared everything
9796,disgusted,It must have been quite interesting Did it make you feel hungry
9797,disgusted,Oh my I can see why It must have been very noisy and animallike
9798,disgusted,Actually I was sickened by it
9823,angry,That sounds so annoying
9824,angry,Just be civil as much as you can
9825,angry,Man your right  I get to feeling so hot and like I can explode
9835,angry,Im sorry I think its an opportunity to start a new job better
9836,angry,thats right  but you have to keep going  I know that you will do well
9837,angry,I agree but it was unfair since I had the highest return in my department
9852,annoyed,whaaat that is insane Alright he must be doing something really LEGAL right lol 
9853,annoyed,some people really are like that though I am not one of those people tho 
9854,annoyed,No people in my area just want to out impress each other even if it means no food for their kids 
9874,disgusted,that literally makes no sense like i get it you are homeless but no reason to be dirty ugh 
9875,disgusted,probably so either way still disgusting 
9876,disgusted,he must have been high 
9892,angry,I know its awful How much did your rent go up
9893,angry,WowYou need to find a new place to live because thats completely unreasonable
9894,angry,another 95 dollars it has went up 3 times in 6 months 
9895,disgusted,Thats gross Did you complain to your landlord
9896,disgusted,Wow thats pretty bad I would complain to someone higher up because thats just disgusting 
9897,disgusted,I did and it took them a month to get it fixed but they came out three times a week thats how bad it was 
9951,annoyed,uhhh i know how you feel we have some young neighbors downstairs and sometimes they have late night parties in their apartment
9952,annoyed,tell me about it i even talked to them several times but they dont care
9953,annoyed,thats so annoying and inconsiderate
9967,angry,That is fair I would be as well
9968,angry,I undertstand that I would be very upset as well
9969,angry,Right I worked hard for that car
10022,angry,Thaqt is too bad  I like cats but not the mean ones only the sweet ones  What does the cat do that is so bad
10023,angry,Yeah I wonder what has made it so mean
10024,angry,not this one
10139,angry,Is that your brewski of choice
10140,angry,Always been a fan of Corona though lately Ive been chugging Hurricanes and Keystones
10141,angry,yes it makes me feel nice and not too tipsy
10155,disgusted,I understand that I hate bugs even alive ones
10156,disgusted,I get that I am the same way
10157,disgusted,me too I know they wont hurt me but for some reason im terrified of them
10211,disgusted,Nice talking to ya
10212,disgusted,I understand that we are not a great generation
10256,annoyed,It is so frustrating when someone elses issues affect your life  What does she do to make you late
10257,annoyed,That might be a good solution for you  Let her catch all the flack for her tardiness
10258,annoyed,She takes forever getting ready I would rather take the bus
10259,angry,That is absolutely horrible Was this recent
10260,angry,I agree You should bring that up to HR 
10261,angry,Yes it was I was furious and hurt Leaders should not do that to their employees
10346,angry,That is awful I hate people who leave their dogs out all day Thats no life for a dog to live at all
10347,angry,That is terrible I dont know why people like that bother getting a pet 
10348,angry,Seriously Tell me about it im not mad at the dog im mad at them poor thing even in the rain
10407,disgusted,It must have been an overwhelming experience how old are the kids now
10408,disgusted,Sweet we all miss those memories of them growing back Mine are adults now
10409,disgusted,They are 14 and 12  It was pretty gross but you have to deal with a lot of gross things when they are babies and just remember that you can take a shower to wash it off  Luckily they have cute little faces to help you forget about the gross things
10410,annoyed,Why did you feel irritated 
10411,annoyed,Oh that sounds super annoying Sorry for that
10412,annoyed,I agreed to help him move but he kept asking about it even though I said yyes
10413,disgusted,That is so sad That poor dog
10414,disgusted,Oh it survived What a lucky dog
10415,disgusted,I was sickened but thankfully someone found it and rescued it
10419,angry,I think he should exercise more selfrestraint when it comes to your relationship
10420,angry,That is very dangerous attitude to have I would be very cautious as it may bring much unintended social consequences
10421,angry,I agree but he doesnt think he is doing anything wrong
10422,angry,Yes it already has in the past I do the best I can
10464,annoyed,Did you try to reason with them
10465,annoyed,You should report them to the authorities
10466,annoyed,i really did but they dont care it just caused more problems  
10485,annoyed,Your husband is just being a good daddy  hahaha you will miss the experience when the kid grows up
10486,annoyed,Then talk with him try to reason with him
10487,annoyed,Well hes very inconsiderate when I am the one that has to clean up the mess He could have just put it in a sippy cup instead 
10586,disgusted,I understand a lot of people have issues with him  What makes you embarrassed
10587,disgusted,Well in his business dealings in the past it probably served him well to be blunt and agressive  I can see how that would bother some people
10588,disgusted,Absolutely everythingHe has no manners
10599,disgusted,Do I even wanna hear it Okay tell me what happened o
10600,disgusted,So you had chocolate covered ants I bet thats pricey somewhere in another country ha ha 
10601,disgusted,you do I was very hungry last night so I reached for some chocolate on my table As I was wrapping themI was so excited Well I put them in my mouth and immediately realized they had ants in them
10633,angry,I am too actually I dont care for them at all
10634,angry,Theyre obsessed with guns what do you expect
10635,angry,The fact they want to allow the online printing of the 3d guns is just disgusting
10659,disgusted,That could happen to anyoneDont feel so bad
10660,disgusted,Keep trying and you will see improvments
10661,disgusted,Yea I will still try new dishes I just cant get the terrible taste out of my mouth
10695,angry,Oh my God thats terrible  So sad  Id be mad too  What did you do
10696,angry,Did the police come I hope she got her stuff back
10697,angry,No kidding  I would hate for that to happen to anyone else
10698,angry,I bet  The world can be so scary  Im glad she was okay
10699,angry,I would have chased that punk down if I was close enough but I saw it from a distance 
10700,angry,They did and I explained in as much detail as I could remember what he looked like Hopefully they catch him
10701,angry,I felt so bad for her She seemed really shook up
10722,disgusted,Why cant you just move away when they smoke
10723,disgusted,That seems like a rather complicated situation than
10724,disgusted,oh no I cant be doing that everyday I will just have to join the board so that I can influence a policy against them
10751,disgusted,oh sorry to hear this you just want to make it up clean soon
10752,disgusted,you have to find the person who did thisthen you should made the mess to clean it up
10753,disgusted,I want whoever made the mess to clean it up  
10763,annoyed,Talk to him wisely
10764,annoyed,Oh I mean talk to him in the way that he will understand With love so that he reasons with you
10765,annoyed,Im not sure what you mean by wisely I could tell him Hey I dont want to pick up after you but Im not sure that would go over well
10827,disgusted,Yes It feels disgusting and you want to throw your shoe away afterwards 
10828,disgusted,No never barefoot I hope you took a long shower Smelling like dog poo wont get you any ladies
10829,disgusted,Yea did you ever do it in the barefooting This is how I did it recently
10830,disgusted,That is very true but I have seen a couple ladies that like that sort of thing
10854,disgusted,Can we use the broken to describe our political system 
10855,disgusted,I agree the political system we have is a mess and I think it will get worse
10856,disgusted,Absolutely Things have gotten so crazy thats its almost pointless to engage others in objective discussion
10875,annoyed,That is horrible Have you ever said anything to him about it
10876,annoyed,Maybe you should mention that you just want a guys night and he would get the hint 
10877,annoyed,I dont know how to bring it up I always hope hed catch subtle hints like when I ask his kids to please not climb on my stuff
10993,annoyed,Whats your orientation
10994,annoyed,I see there are some jerks out there in this world
10995,annoyed,I am a rainbow person if you know what I mean
11002,angry,Do you think they are messing up the country
11003,angry,Yeah they feed off of his crazy I think
11004,angry,It is mostly TrumpI am mad because they will not stand up to Trump
11018,annoyed,Have you tried taking any aspirin I feel bad for you my friend
11019,annoyed,Yeah sometimes you have to do that to get better I would take another dose if I were you
11020,annoyed,I did but its not doing the trick I dont want to be laying around the rest of the day but I dont think I have a choice
11035,angry,Holy moly thats some rough luck Did you find the guy who did it
11036,angry,Dang dude Is your insurance company covering it at least
11037,angry,They have not found anyone yet  What really hacks me off is our security cameras did not get a good view of the person
11047,angry,How did that happen I would be so upset
11048,angry,Did Starbucks not make you a new one I am definitely grumpy if I dont get my morning coffee 
11049,angry,Well it was pretty busy so I think he just thought it was his Maybe we had the same name Anywho all I know is is that I was far grumpier than usual
11050,angry,Oh well its still fun that you got to participate in that
11051,angry,Haha thats really a cute story though
11052,angry,Yeah I do recall that it was a swell time I was pretty peeved that I lost though I studied so hard
11078,annoyed,You should confiscate his video game and teach him a lesson
11079,annoyed,You are doing the right thing for him to learn discipline
11080,annoyed,Thats definitely my plan He will learn there will be consequences for his failure to listen
11090,disgusted,Oh no that mustve been awful 
11091,disgusted,Woah that sounds like a very unpleasant experience I hope its never gonna happen to you again
11092,disgusted,Oh you dont even know I was covered in filth that Cradle of Filth doesnt even know about I was so disgusted that I thought I was going to die
11093,angry,Thats a bummer What happened once you moved there
11094,angry,Its good to hear that your experience was fulfilling I hope I can have a similar once someday
11095,angry,It was an awesome experience and after I came back to the US I felt so fulfilled and my perspective on everything has changed 
11102,annoyed,it sucks when you cant depend on coworkers
11103,annoyed,well i hope some better people get hired
11104,annoyed,Yeah
11105,annoyed,Unlikely companys not doing well right now  they can fire people but they wont get to back full  So were stuck withem
11163,disgusted,Yeah it sure is Especially when you are streaming or talking to someone in the moment
11164,disgusted,Completely frustrating I usually end up calling customer service and complaining until its fixed if it happens repeatedly 
11165,disgusted,Exactly it causes a little impotence not knowing how to solve it
11166,disgusted,Thank God in most cases they solve it quickly
11170,angry,Oh no that is terrible Are you guys still talking now
11171,angry,Well that is not good What did she do that was so bad
11172,angry,No not at all its a little tense
11173,angry,She wanted to try to use all of the money she had saved up only a few hundred after two months to go visit a friend in California even though she was supposed to be saving up for her own place or school and when we said no she started insulting us 
11180,annoyed,Yeah kids get crazy when they are bored  Get them to read a book
11181,annoyed,You might need to lay down the law and ground them
11182,annoyed,I tried they dont even want to do that So frustrating
11198,annoyed,Oh no I hate when that happens  People always feel a need to look and it causes the other lanes to be at a standstill as well  How long did you have to wait
11199,annoyed,Adding time to your commute from work to home is the worst  I mean youve put in a full day you just want to get home
11200,annoyed,It added a lovely 20 minutes to my drive home
11201,annoyed,I know
11220,annoyed,How did that go
11221,annoyed,The cigarette break is not a good sign at all
11222,annoyed,She wasnt the type of person that listened very well In fact she decided to go smoke a cigarette during our training session
11223,annoyed,That was exactly what I thought
11307,disgusted,What kind of jacket did they steal from you
11308,disgusted,Sorry to hear that did you eventually get it back or no
11309,disgusted,My favorite outdoor one
11310,disgusted,I dont think I will
11347,angry,Dang That is annoying
11348,angry,You must have informed them abou this
11349,angry,Yeah it made me kind of ticked off frankly but I didnt say anything
11363,annoyed,Wow  That is a sight to wake up to  What did you do
11364,annoyed,I can imagine  I would be burning that sheet set
11365,annoyed,I had to pick her up and wash her and then clean up the mess It was really annoying
11385,annoyed,Oh man that sounds awful I thought the 7 hour drives we did with 3 of us were awful
11386,annoyed,Thats rough I feel for you But as you said its over so life goes on 
11387,annoyed,Yeah add another one in and double the time and youll have our trip The youngest has ADHD too so that always keeps it interesting 
11388,annoyed,Yeah I still wake up with cold sweats after nightmares about hearing Are we there yet over and over again 
11436,angry,OH no I really dislike theives
11437,angry,Do you have insurance
11438,angry,You should think about that for all of your stuff got situations like this
11439,angry,I felt really bad
11440,angry,No I dont have for the mower
11496,annoyed,Sticky paper is so gross have you every used cloves You can put the in your windows to keep flies out
11497,annoyed,I donr know Once I found out about cloves that worked fr me Maybe you should het an exterminator although that seems extreme
11498,annoyed,Probablt Im sorry I couldnt help you 
11499,annoyed,I have clove oil and I have tried basil It seems like the little tiny fly babies get in so I can barely have my window open My lawn is mowed but it drives me crazy and it takes all day to kill them Then it restarts the next day Any flowers that keep them away
11500,annoyed,No way to get rid of flies with that I have pets so I dont want any poison for them or the earth There are lots of abandoned houses around here I am sure that contributes
11554,disgusted,Oh that sound alful Some people have zero respect for others belonging and even less for things we all need to share
11555,disgusted,It is sad Espically since if the same people acted like they cared and wanted to they could help make the enviroment better for everyone 
11556,disgusted,I know right It is so ghetto in my neighborhood but I just cannot stand people who behave that way Yes zero respect and zero care for even their own things let alone others Its sad
11564,disgusted,I hate when people do that
11565,disgusted,I am not sure that is a good question
11566,disgusted,it was hot out too I couldnt believe it She had also whipped in in front of cars with two kids Seriously why do some people have kids
11616,angry,What happened to it
11617,angry,That doesnt sound so hard to fix
11618,angry,Im not sure It wouldnt start the morning   Its not the batttery or starter
11619,angry,Well I dont know whats broken so thats a bit of a problem
11639,angry,Aw poor kitty Well that is their fault for sure Have you spoke to them about it Also you can get these spray things that keep cast out of your yard They spray them with water when they cross a barrier
11640,angry,Oh man Well some owners suck I would definitely look in to the water sprayers Is the cat fixed 
11641,angry,its a big old cat its not a kitty I kept telling the owners but they dont care
11851,annoyed,That sounds really annoying  You should confront him and request he stop
11852,annoyed,That would make me really angry  Call a tow truck to teach him a lesson
11853,annoyed,I have asked him a few times but he obviously doesnt care 
11867,angry,happens all the time in the city i live in people are rude 
11868,angry,yup no reason to stoop to their level you did right 
11869,angry,Definitely I didnt lay on the horn though that just makes it worse
11870,disgusted,I hope you didnt use any
11871,disgusted,Was the soup good at least
11872,disgusted,Not from that bottle at least
11892,disgusted,Thats got to be frustrating for you
11893,disgusted,Have you tried asking for a raise yourself

12978,annoyed,Thats really nice What does he usually get at the store
12979,annoyed,Sounds a lot like me I love going through the toys and gadgets section to see if I can find anything for my kids
12980,annoyed,Mainly groceries but he always wanders through the clearance aisles of toys and gadgets and takes forever while we just sit and wait on him to eat dinner
12988,angry,Haha why

12990,angry,The country needs a border wall with Mexico and the dims keep blocking the resolution

13064,angry,Hmmm sounds like an unpleasant job Maybe they ask you for help because youre the only one around It doesnt hurt to help those in need
13065,angry,That is a fair point You cant have those that are there to protect us be distracted This is a key tenant when Im on watch in the Navy
13066,angry,i understand but im there to make sure everybody is safe if i start helping customers i might miss a person getting a gun out or something like that

13130,disgusted,I specifically asked for no onions
13131,disgusted,I got a new burger but my apetite was ruined by then
13236,disgusted,Dang that is some nasty stuff Did you take your shoe and shove it in the face of your sworn enemies
13237,disgusted,I guess you shouldnt clean the poop off your shoe then Save it for when the time comes
13238,disgusted,Haha maybe next time
13313,annoyed,Thats one of those things that never gets old to complain about because its one of lifes timetested annoyances And whats worse is you open the door or window for them and they still refuse to leave
13314,annoyed,And you never have a flyswatter when you need one Like who keeps one of those around Although I always have flipflops because I live near the coast so that makes a decent flyswatter
13315,annoyed,I know Its like the fly loves to annoy me lol
13316,disgusted,That is hilarious
13317,disgusted,OH no Im sorry I laughed then

13339,disgusted,They leave trash everywhere and so do their guests
13340,disgusted,I dont want to start a fight though
13452,annoyed,I am sorry to hear that Do you know the reason why
13453,annoyed,Perhaps talking to your doctor would be a good idea
13454,annoyed,I think it has something to do with my metabolism Not really sure to be honest
13498,disgusted,That is so disgusting What did you do
13499,disgusted,That must have been a terrible situation
13500,disgusted,I refused to clean up after him And I made sure I was there as little as possible He smelled so bad
13531,annoyed,Oh yes kids can be a lot apartments should always have kids on the bottom
13532,annoyed,I dont know why some people have kids

13537,annoyed,What happened
13538,annoyed,Ah gotcha I hope it works out for him and you
13539,annoyed,too many outside distractions trying to run a church while working at his real job
13558,angry,why did he do that
13559,angry,that sucks
13560,angry,Because he was sad at the result I suppose
13579,disgusted,Ew why not a napkin
13580,disgusted,Times are tough
13581,disgusted,It was so gross I think he was homeless
13606,disgusted,That can be hard sometimes Have you talked to them about it
13607,disgusted,I would try and be honest with them about it and tell them it makes you uncomfortable 
13608,disgusted,Well I love honesty and everything but I think someones sex life is private and I dont want to know about it in that context
13648,disgusted,In a cool antique way or a disgusting way
13649,disgusted,That is so gross Did you complain to them
13650,disgusted,Disgusting that cap was so crusty it was unbelievable I dont know why they dont replace them montly ugh
13704,disgusted,What did you eat
13705,disgusted,Where did you go after you left
13706,disgusted,Nothing because I lost my appetite after attempting to use the restrooms and then realizing how dirty smelly and gross they were We had to leave after that
13740,disgusted,I sorry that you have to deal with that
13741,disgusted,Yeah you need to get of there quickly

13815,annoyed,Yeah I didnt think I would be rooming with an adult 12 year old though
13862,angry,Oh that sucks I can barely do 5 without needing a break
13863,angry,Thats quite unfortunate I feel for you as I used to live in a small town where jobs were scarce Its rough when there is no competition
13864,angry,Honestly its starting to feel like they have it out for me I want to leave but there isnt anywhere else to work around here
13865,angry,Guess I will just have to grin and bear it 
13887,annoyed,sorry to hear that Sometimes there can be a technical  problem
13888,annoyed,sorry about that seems their customer service is not welcoming
13889,annoyed,Yeah it can be frustrating when the workers there just shrug their shoulders and offer nothing in return
13890,annoyed,I wish customer service was better these days It is a declining service
13891,disgusted,Some people think they know all the answers Its sad as they usually dont grow as much as people
13892,disgusted,I hope he does for his sake But I imagine he will come around
13893,disgusted,If he does not behave himself I am afraid I would have to write a query so that he is removed 
13903,angry,Wow I would have been upset How did you react
13904,angry,Are they going to pay you back for it
13905,angry,I was very upset
13906,angry,I never found out who it was unfortunately
14020,annoyed,Oh thats terrible  Did he say how he lost it
14021,annoyed,Do you remember the title  Maybe you can get another copy
14022,annoyed,Yea he accidentally left it out in the rain So of course its no good anymore
14036,disgusted,Ive never been in one but I always assumed they were cleaner
14037,disgusted,Ew thats gross Some people have no sense of decency 
14038,disgusted,Not at all Someone left a dirty diaper in the sink
14078,angry,Ouch thats rough Maybe she just isnt ready 
14079,angry,Do you have any proof If so you should bring it up to her
14080,angry,I think she is secretly cheating on me 
14081,angry,She has been quite demanding lately she wants to eat out in the most expensive resturants she wants the most expensive cloths and jewelleris 
14095,angry,If it wasnt your fault then what caused you to lose
14096,angry,Multiplayer games can be fun but thats certainly a downfall to them
14097,angry,My stupid teammates all left the game I was doing really well but couldnt win by myself
14128,annoyed,What was she doing
14129,annoyed,There is a lot of that type of behavior now Its like people have lost their minds
14130,annoyed,She was on her bluetooth screaming to the person she was talking to So rude
14137,angry,Oh yea Ive had it happen a few times Its even worse when they lose the package for a while
14138,angry,I dont blame you I try to keep tabs on them because I dont trust they will be delivered in time I also set up a camera to catch deliveries that dont deliver 
14139,angry,Yes Thats why I have to stay on top of the package tracking because you never know when something could go wrong
14140,angry,Thats a smart idea Hopefully I dont encounter issues like this again in the future
14171,angry,What were you expected to be served
14172,angry,So how did you handle it

14425,disgusted,She promised to go and do that since she realizes how i feel 
14426,disgusted,I think she still loves me regardless thats why
14436,annoyed,He should be understanding of that and not keep on Thats just frustrating for everyone involved
14437,annoyed,Sounds very immature if you ask me
14438,annoyed,I wish he was more understanding But sometimes he seems to miss some obvious facts

15863,annoyed,They never pay for anything and always look to me when the bill comes
15888,angry,That would be annoying  How about meeting up with a friend or something

16765,angry,I did I had just went grocery shopping We were gone all day and it was 100 degrees today
16766,angry,I will try to find one tomorrow 
16798,annoyed,That makes me mad too
16799,annoyed,People let things get out of hand and it is so unecessary
16800,annoyed,I know right Why cant you just be nice and keep it calm and peaceful No one wants any drama Dont be a jerk is my motto If you cant say nothing nice then keep it to yourself or keep it peaceful
16801,angry,Uh oh Was everything ruined
16802,angry,Oh how disappointing 
16803,angry,We only had popsicles in there But I wanted those popsicles lol
16804,angry,I know
16808,angry,I swear the DMV is the worst
16809,angry,Yeah but the state would never get out of debt if they had to pay the people for missing work just to wait in inefficient lines at the DMV
16810,angry,You know it  They should have to pay me for the work I missed
16819,disgusted,Lol Thats gross
16820,disgusted,I wouldnt either She should find another job lol
16821,disgusted,Youre  telling me It was absolutely revolting I am never going to let her live that down
16835,angry,Oh darn that is stressful I bet
16836,angry,Thats no good How does that happen
16837,angry,I have lost every single one I have ever had
16838,angry,I have no earthly idea
16906,disgusted,Oh wow that is disgusting
16907,disgusted,What are you going to do
16908,disgusted,Oh it was I afraid for my well being
16912,angry,Thats a bummer Did you get it repaired
16913,angry,Well thats good At least everything turned out okay in the end
16914,angry,I did after a few hours
16964,angry,You need to speak up next time
16965,angry,Good thats what needed to happen
16966,angry,I spoke up and was very angry
17027,angry,Sometimes sibling rivalry dies hard  even when youve well outgrown it Are yall far apart in age
17028,angry,I love your heart Thats important Are you a brother or a sister to them
17029,angry,Please do Sometimes it takes time to mature on an emotional level Its cool that you have that on them 
17030,angry,I have one thats four years old than me and one thats eight years older than me They do like to gang up on me especially since its easier just because Im a lot less further along in life than they are because of age They really can be tough But I feel like its important to stay close to family
17031,angry,Im a brother to them And thank you for the compliment Ill just try to stay positive
17035,disgusted,That is nasty What are you going to do
17036,disgusted,I am with you 
17037,disgusted,Im thinking about hiring an exterminator I cant gave vermin like that running amok around my house
17092,disgusted,how did it go congrats btw
17093,disgusted,hah  it gets better
17094,disgusted,It was pretty darn gross Thought I was going to vomit
17205,annoyed,Im sorry to hear that Sometimes kids dont know how to interact well with each other But its an important part of the socializing part of life that they work their way through it All you can do is tell them how to respectfully and appropriately respond and defend themselves
17206,annoyed,Ah so its that kind of situation Yeah it can be one thing if its just something where kids are acting like kids and you cant physically intervene in time But its another if you think its neglect and that theyre not responding appropriately to the situation I would trust your judgment I hope everything ends well with it though Im sure you gave your child lots of love afterward
17207,annoyed,I didnt do that  I yelled at the teacher until I got tired then I left  I dont think Ill send my son back there
17208,angry,It happens even when we study hard sometimes
17209,angry,true Life is full of learning I am glad you have learned something from it so many dont Kudos
17210,angry,I know at least I learned from it
17250,disgusted,Oh gross What restaurant
17251,disgusted,I would blast them on social media That is not good especially for them not to take responsibility for it
17252,disgusted,It was a nearby pho place Im not going there again
17260,disgusted,Wow I hope it was a clean diaper
17261,disgusted,Who knew a diaper would be so terrifying
17262,disgusted,Nope  It was horrifying  It changed everything for me
17368,angry,I am sorry roommates can be annoying sometimes
17369,angry,I will not either
17370,angry,Not a roomate lolbut yes Thats how life works though If you want things and luxuries they cost money Ill never understand entitled people
17396,annoyed,Dont be too hard on yourself You taught yourself a lesson for next time
17397,annoyed,Im in college I understand Just have to keep pushing forward and youll so great
17398,annoyed,Yeah I will do better next time for sure
17399,disgusted,Oh no  I have experienced that before and its not pleasant  Its hard to be kind and careful with your speech and actions when youre near a snob
17400,disgusted,Seriously  I just keep thinking that they are a person just like me and it doesnt always means they are better than me just because they are entitled  As they say everyone puts their pants on one leg at a time
17401,disgusted,Oh manSO TRUE It really makes me want to be nasty Behaving like a dictator is not acceptable from even a dictator
17402,annoyed,Ugh So you have corrupt police officers in your town too That is a bummer
17403,annoyed,I would too Most officers dont show up for that
17404,annoyed,Yes  Im a great driver with a perfect record but did I get a warning  No  I got a ticket but Im going to contest it in court  
17435,annoyed,That is terrible
17436,annoyed,Police here do that sometimes It sucks
17437,annoyed,I know right I cant wait to move Seems like I cant ever go walking at night without them rolling up as if they dont have a million other things to do
17461,angry,Oh no what happened
17462,angry,You should check if they raised your rates unexpectedly or maybe something you bought is eating up a lot of electricity
17463,angry,I have no idea i am so mad
17487,angry,What are they doing
17488,angry,Oh lol Well it
17489,angry,Sorry I meant that kids do that enjoy it mom while they are little 
17490,angry,I told them to go to bed hours ago I can still hear them giggling
17491,angry,They do that every night I cant wait for school to start
17492,disgusted,I feel sorr for the poor guy
17493,disgusted,Yea theyre his parents I can imagine everyone being hesitant about telling them what not to do with their own child
17494,disgusted,Yeah me too I tried to comfort him afterwards Theres only so much you can do No one was brave enough to chastise the parents for trying to get him to eat more than he should
17518,disgusted,People can be inconsiderate sometimes I hope you dont get sick
17519,disgusted,Thats true Its nice of you to put yourself in their shoes
17520,disgusted,Well well see Im generally pretty healthy and havent been to the doctor in like over 6 years for anything other than the flu So hopefully my immune system will keep it at bay But it was just its something so simple and avoidable and they didnt do it I guess I should feel more empathy for them though since theyre sick
17552,angry,Thats terrible Sometimes its hard to know who your real friends are and it takes repeated attempts to hang out with them only to have them bail on you to realize that youre not valued by them I say cut your ties sooner rather than later Lifes too short
17553,angry,Oh man When you consider all that then yeah definitely cut ties If they did that to me more than twice then I would realize really quick that they werent the type to depend on or waste time on I feel sorry for you People should have friends that recognize their worth and be able to respect that relationship Go out and find you someone who will
17554,angry,I have to get a baysitter and spend moen just to prepare to go out Its so inconsiderate I think I need new friends
17555,angry,Thats really good advice I can have a better time with other peopl
17559,disgusted,Oh god Someone did pick up their dogs poop hu
17560,disgusted,It mustve been I hope that never happens to you again
17561,disgusted,No unfortunately not  It really grossed me out
17570,annoyed,Thats a bummer
17571,annoyed,Whos concert
17572,annoyed,It is Now its going to be hard to take off work for the makeup concert
17627,annoyed,That isnt cool  Is there anyone else that sells it

17629,annoyed,I looked up some others stores and just bought a bag from Home Depot The birds seemt o like it
17639,disgusted,You and me both my friend
17640,disgusted,I know it is so disturbing
17641,disgusted,He just acting more erratic with the passing of time
17669,disgusted,Why What did they do
17670,disgusted,I understand your frustration
17671,disgusted,They keep   defending those sanctuary cities that are full of criminal imigrants
17681,angry,Why would they do that
17682,angry,Man did you say anything
17683,angry,I have no clue but I was really upset about it
17720,disgusted,Wow that is really gross
17721,disgusted,I can sympathize with you
17722,disgusted,yea i wanted to puke a little
17746,angry,I am sorry to hear thatWe you expecting somthing very expensive
17747,angry,Did you get in touch with  the postal office
17748,angry,Yes its a Nintendo Switch  I am so furious about the situation
17773,angry,Thats good What kind of parade was it
17774,angry,Oh my gosh I would have been so mad Did you call them and complain They need to fix it
17775,angry,The parade in the County Fair When I got home from the car wash I noticed that the car wash had stipped my cars paint
17779,angry,Thats a shame you shouldnt have to do that
17780,angry,Things will get better soon
17781,angry,Yes but the boss is not nice
17782,angry,Did you call the manager and complain
17783,angry,You should of called and told them
17784,angry,No I am just so disappointed about it
17788,annoyed,Do you talk softly
17789,annoyed,You should tell them
17790,annoyed,No it really gets on my nerves
17830,angry,How did she dump you
17831,angry,Will you still be friends with her
17832,angry,She said that she wasnt ready for a relationship
17899,disgusted,oh my was it worth it
17900,disgusted,what a joke are you going to sue
17901,disgusted,NO My 30 salad had a hair in it
17965,annoyed,Did they have permission to take it
17966,annoyed,I hope you can learn to forgive them for it 
17967,annoyed,No they did not  It really bugs me
17968,angry,oh no did you block your cards
17969,angry,what are you going to do about it
17970,angry,Yes I am so upset I lost it
17974,disgusted,eww thats awful
17975,disgusted,i bet it was
17976,disgusted,Yeah it was really gross to see
18021,disgusted,Really lol
18022,disgusted,It will be
18023,disgusted,It was so nasty to look at
18135,angry,Thats horrible  This is why they say never a lender nor a borrower be
18136,angry,I hope it wasnt a lot of money  Sometimes it takes a hard lesson to learn whom to let in your life
18137,angry,Well even worse is that he pretends like it never happened It make thingsdifficult
18167,angry,Thats really tough  But one closed door leads to the next great opportunity
18168,angry,Thats horrible  If you dont have insurance there are a lot of pro bono lawyers that will take your case  Report it to the police so it is documented and justice will prevail  You dont deserve or need to put up with that
18169,angry,Before he left he damaged a lot of my stuff and property
18195,angry,Thats terrible  How did you find out
18196,angry,Its hard to find forgiveness for something like that  Still its better that he confessed than you having to find out otherwise  If only a little better
18197,angry,My friend confessed which I give kudos for but he knows what he did It doesnt make it ok
18201,angry,Oh no I hate that happened and I bet it was scary because it looked like someone broke in But now you have a repair bill Sorry that happened to you
18202,angry,I hope the persons conscience makes them feel guilty and they come clean about the situation And hopefully reimburse you
18203,angry,Yes it was scary I was watching TV when happened
18240,angry,Oh no did she say something really upsetting
18241,angry,Oh thats the worstI wish people would just say what they want to say
18242,angry,The exact opposite She ghosted me right after despite saying the date was good
18254,annoyed,I understand Were you able to manage the situation
18255,annoyed,It is ok It was a scary situation
18256,annoyed,Pretty much but it involved yelling
18273,angry,Why would they do such a thing
18274,angry,That is so bad the police should be called for that
18275,angry,Some person doent want to pay for anything
18285,disgusted,That is disgusting What did you do to clean it
18286,disgusted,Did the smell went away
18287,disgusted,i used some clorox and a wipe
18325,disgusted,Oh no How was your coworker doing afterwards
18326,disgusted,He had a good amount of time to recuperate Thats good to hear
18327,disgusted,He was okay after two weeks at home
18331,angry,ooh sorry how is it now does he have a job
18332,angry,ok sorry for that 
18333,angry,He has one now but it was maddening back then
18334,disgusted,What was
18335,disgusted,I am not sure what you are talking about
18336,disgusted,so bad to see a girl pee
18370,angry,That is not good
18371,angry,I am sorry you will get another one
18372,angry,I agree I am so livid right now It was an expensive phone
18373,angry,ooooh thats so bad what happened
18374,angry,sorry now how is the situation

18858,disgusted,haha did you find the friends
18859,disgusted,Killed it then took stripped my bed apart to look for his friends
18860,disgusted,No Which probably means they were able to exfiltrate the area 
18879,angry,Yikes how much will it cost to replace
18880,angry,That would be best they can get expensive to fix
18881,angry,Im not sure Hopefully not too much  I think I can just fix the screen
18900,annoyed,I completely understand Cant live with them cant live without them  ha ha ha
18901,annoyed,How long you been together
18902,annoyed,That is true it is interesting but we still love each other at the end of the day
18906,angry,I am the black sheep in mine self declared
18907,angry,No he didnt but at least they were admitting they were assholes you didnt have to wait till you were older to figure it out
18908,angry,Me too but he didnt have to broadcast it to everyone like that
18912,annoyed,How rude  Are you two roommates
18913,annoyed,What was it that he ate
18914,annoyed,Yes I was so hungry and went to the fridge to discover that it was all missing

18965,angry,Did he jump up and run away
18966,angry,I yelled at it and told it to leave  I live near a lake and all there is no getting rid of animals  
18967,angry,Yeah he ran off  I sure he will visit agian
19031,annoyed,Language barriers can be pretty problematic Always keep an open ear though
19032,annoyed,Thats fair The same would be true in any other nation
19033,annoyed,Yes I know I try my best to understand what they are trying to say but its annoying
19099,disgusted,Oh no Thats disgusting They should take better care of him
19100,disgusted,I would have been nauseous too
19101,disgusted,I was so disgusted and lost my appetite
19141,annoyed,Ugh I am with you on that Mine has been doing that all week Its so annoying and it costs even more to switch to someone else
19142,annoyed,Sometimes resetting the modem  router helps But it wont do much if the ISP isnt good to begin with Careful with going too cheap though you might end up worse
19143,annoyed,I know right I usually try disconnecting and reconnecting it but it doesnt do anything I need to find a cheaper ISP
19144,annoyed,Thank you maybe I need to find a more expensive alternative then haha
19178,angry,well something must have gone wrong somehow I think you should talk to your vet doctor
19179,angry,Yes I think you can try chaining it
19180,angry,I will later today but I suspect he got into something he shouldnt have No more free roaming for a while
19186,angry,Why What happened
19187,angry,Wow what the heck Tell your chief it was your assistant who did it
19188,angry,my assistant took some files in a wrong tablethat was a simple mistake and he scolded me for this
19189,angry,i did but my chief didnt listen my wordshe told me that this is your responsibility
19234,angry,Whats an ice chest 
19235,angry,Oh I should have known that Do you have any leads on who mightve stolen it
19236,angry,Its a insulated box for storing cold goods
19237,angry,No clue 
19241,annoyed,On what situation 
19242,annoyed,My opinion is I dont mind doing my own job but if I have to do my coworkers jobs I would get furious It is not fair
19243,annoyed,I dont like doing my job and the duties of other coworker that slack
19244,annoyed,Its not fair at all
19269,disgusted,Thats pretty awful Some people have serious mental problems
19270,disgusted,It is very sad
19271,disgusted,I know  Its just so hard to see when innocent children are victims  It breaks my heart
19272,disgusted,Mental health issues are a huge problemI wish we could do better with helping those needing mental help
19301,angry,Whats that Hope it wasnt too bad
19302,angry,Oh wow what a bummer Not that it makes it any better but at least youre not alone Maybe youll get a refund
19303,angry,I was all ready to go and see my favorite band and then the entire show was canceled
19304,angry,Yes I did get the refund
19331,disgusted,It really limits your dietary choices  I dont recommend it   Have you considered vegetarian
19332,disgusted,Or you could even just drop the vege anything and just minimize your animal protein intake
19333,disgusted,I havent but maybe Ill give it a try
19334,annoyed,I bet you were very annoyed
19335,annoyed,Wow you prepared for this type of thing and it still happened I would express my annoyance with the doctor for sure
19336,annoyed,I was I actually scheduled the first appointment of the day just to make sure that didnt happen
19337,annoyed,I really wanted to He was late because he was having breakfast with his son Nice but not on my schedule
19347,angry,Oh Big fight or one of those little fights
19348,angry,Ah I see Well I hope it at least got worked out for you guys
19349,angry,Big fight These kinds of thingspicking out foodsmake me very frustrated because I have ADHDAspergers 
19350,angry,It did I just wish I had handled it better and that he could have been more patient 
19370,disgusted,Thats disgusting  Makes me wonder what their kitchen looks like
19371,disgusted,Id atleast leave a review about it
19372,disgusted,I know right I should have let them know to be honest
19395,angry,oh no that can be nerve wracking are you alright
19396,angry,thats happened to me before and it really shakes you at least you are alright which is the important part
19397,angry,Yes I am just a little upset right now
19489,angry,Did you find out who your father is yet
19490,angry,Did you dad and the other lady have a thing
19491,angry,Yes I knew from my mothers best friend
19513,angry,Wow thats annoying  but I hope they gave you more than you were supposed to get back
19514,angry,Wow thats annoying  but I hope they gave you more than you were supposed to get back
19515,angry,You should call and ask to speak to the manager  Maybe they will give you something to make up for it
19516,angry,Not the worst part is that cashier insisted I had given her 10 when I was sure it was 20
19517,angry,I had to speak to the manger to get my money back
19518,angry,I did and he gave me my money but nothing else
19533,annoyed,Gee thats no fun I hope it wasnt too early There are usually laws about making noise early in the morning
19534,annoyed,Yes thats a good idea I think 7am is way too early for that
19535,annoyed,They started hammering away at 7am  I think I am going to call their boss and complain  Maybe ill call him tomorrow at 7am
19539,annoyed,I have four dogs  I am probably guilty of this crime  I would just throw it back over
19540,annoyed,One time this lady 1 house away scooped up all the cat poo from my cat under her window into a bag and put it on my front door with a note  I thought why did she clean it up for me  Wouldnt it have been more affective to ask me to clean it up  
19541,annoyed,I usually leave it on their front door step  lol
19549,angry,Oh no did you hurt yourself
19550,angry,How did the dirtbike hold up And how old are you
19551,angry,Oh dear sounds like a serious accident Im glad you are okay Could have been terrible 
19552,angry,Im glad youre okay that must have been scary 
19553,angry,I did had so many cuts on my leg Mom had to bandage me up
19554,angry,It was fine just my leg was all mangled The cop drove me home thankfully
19555,angry,Very thankful that it wasnt worse
19562,angry,Wow some people are horrible drivers  Did you honk at him
19563,angry,At least you didnt get into an accident  I guess it could have been a lot worse
19564,angry,Yes I did I let him know he needed to at least use his indicators He didnt even signal
19583,angry,Oh no How did that happen 
19584,angry,Gee I hope you can find it Maybe retract where you have been recently and you will find it
19585,angry,I dont know But now I am upset because I wasnt able to make it to my favorite gym
19642,annoyed,Sometimes you have to put people in their place
19643,annoyed,Well I hope he learned his lesson We dont play those games where im from
19644,annoyed,Yeah he was being really uncooperative and seemed to not care about other peoples time
19645,annoyed,I feel the same way a couple of my other roommates agreed and I think he learned
19649,annoyed,Oh no Did you eventually get it working after the frustration
19650,annoyed,Thats frustrating nothing ever seems to go right the first time you try it Glad you got it working finally
19651,annoyed,I did but something shorted out and blew out my dimmer switch I had to make another trip to Home Depot to fix it
19706,disgusted,What was the gross part about the sandwich
19707,disgusted,Yes that is a nasty thing to experience But at least you were able to extract the hair
19708,disgusted,I took three bites into the sandwich and about half way as I pulled back from the sandwich was a hair connected from my mouth being pulled out of the food Ive never experienced something like that from fast food
19709,disgusted,Haha I like that you looked on the brightside of that situation at least
19710,annoyed,That really stinks I bet you will wear bug spray next time
19711,annoyed,Well then maybe you should get some bats They love to eat mosquitos
19712,annoyed,bug spray doesnt do anything for me
19713,annoyed,we have bats like crazy here i wish they would eat up all the mosquitos
19720,disgusted,I like a good hard bread like Pumpernickel Do you know what that word means
19721,disgusted,It means the devils fart haha Good bread though
19722,disgusted,No what does it mean
19767,annoyed,I hope nobody was trying to cut you off
19768,annoyed,Oh God that must have been aggravating Hopefully you can get it dismissed
19769,annoyed,I got pulled over and I was given a speeding ticket for going 55 in a 50MPH zone
19776,disgusted,Oh wow thats disappointing 
19777,disgusted,Im really sorry to hear that 
19778,disgusted,it really was  i really dont like sweet food at all i cant even stand candy
19812,annoyed,really How did you meet them
19813,annoyed,I hope they arent like a crazy stalker or anything  Be careful
19814,annoyed,I met them at the store But there is more
19815,annoyed,Exactly that is what I heard from my older and more trusted friend
19829,disgusted,Thats gross What was it
19830,disgusted,I would have thrown up Did you tell the manager
19831,disgusted,I looked down and realized I had bitten into a cockroach I was appalled but finished the food anyway Guess I got my protein for the day
19845,angry,Thats really hard  Im sure that was disappointing after putting in so many years  Sorry
19846,angry,Wow  Well if that was the culture and climate of that workplace you are definitely better off not working for them  Very sad
19847,angry,It was but honestly it was the best thing for my family  I had just told them that I was pregnant with my 2nd child and I truly think they did not want to share me with the family I was creating
19862,angry,That is a real bummer I hope your friend gets it repaired for you
19863,angry,Well you probably wont be lending your car again any time soon hahah
19864,angry,Well its a giant hassle to manage from the insurance side but apparently they will cover it if he doesnt Might hike my rates though
19871,disgusted,Thats disgusting I would have a very hard time finishing that walk Did you go straight home
19872,disgusted,Oh my gosh that makes it so much worse I have done that before too so I hope that neither one of us has that happen again
19873,disgusted,Yes I was wearing sandals so I went home to wash it off ASAP
19901,angry,I know exactly what you mean I have been let down many times and its never a good feeling
19902,angry,You can and should make the best of it You should have a blast and binge watch some TV show
19903,angry,I  had plans to go out with my friends tonight but suddenly everyone is busy now and Im stuck home alone
19931,angry,Oh no  And that is hard to get out  Do you have a waterproof cover on the bed by any chance
19932,angry,oh YUCK  Well Id suggest a waterproof mattress cover just in case it happens again  At least if it does happen again it wont get into the mattress and you can wash the rest of the bed clothes  Im so sorry you discovered it that way
19933,angry,Nope I only discovered it when I tried to lay down on it too So gross
19978,angry,I hate rude drivers like that I swear they should not be able to drive
19979,angry,Yeah that would not have ended well I usually take a picture of their license plate and publicly shame them on social media haha
19980,angry,Part of me wanted to follow him and give him a piece of my mind but thankfully cooler heads prevailed  
20023,disgusted,Oh gross what kind of animal was it
20024,disgusted,Oh wow you think they would get to cleaning up an animal that big as soon as possible Glad its gone now though
20025,disgusted,A small doe The worst part about this was that they decided they had better things to do and didnt get around to cleaning it up for nearly 4 weeks it seemed
20040,angry,I didnt sorry Im not really a soccer fan Why were you mad
20041,angry,As I understand it Croatia were the underdogs so I can totally understand supporting that
20042,angry,Croatia should have won I always support them
20056,annoyed,Yikes I hate when that happens I had a similar situation happen over Christmas Did you make your flight
20057,annoyed,I totally know that feeling It seems that everyone thinks that their situation is more important that everyone elses 
20058,annoyed,I did thankfully The worst part of that situation was I politely told the woman I had been waiting and she totally snapped at me Traveling brings out the worst in people sometimes
20059,annoyed,Yeah and who knows maybe hers was but you dont get anywhere by being rude to people
20064,annoyed,I wonder why Maybe his busy
20065,annoyed,I see Do you feel okay when he invites others or is it a bit uncomfortable
20066,annoyed,Im not sure He might be trying to invite someone else as well He does that from time to time
20074,annoyed,my sisters can be irritating as well no one knows how to push your buttons like family
20075,annoyed,oh no hopefully it was an innocent prank
20076,annoyed,Yeah true that yesterday she pranked me again I was really mad at her
20086,angry,That sucks Is your day going better now at least
20087,angry,Pizza makes everything better Hope your night ends on a good note
20088,angry,Somewhat I have a little bit of a headache now but we just had some good pizza so Im happy
20127,annoyed,Oh god Mosquitos Have you heard about scientists trying to make them extinct
20128,annoyed,I dont see any negative aspect to it but maybe there tis
20129,annoyed,i did not hear about that  but that sounds really interesting hopefully its for the better
20170,angry,Im glad you didnt  Do you have these days often
20171,angry,Honestly I would have freaked out  I cant stand bad drivers
20172,angry,I got a new car just a couple of weeks ago and today I was sitting at a red light and some guy came really close to hitting me  Like he stopped only a few inches away
20173,disgusted,That sounds like a pretty disgusting situation
20174,disgusted,Thats a rough situation I hope you can look back on it later and laugh as well
20175,disgusted,everyone was either laughing at me or disgusted
20220,annoyed,ohh what did you try to explain them
20221,annoyed,Ohh sometimes people dont understand simple things I think the words like petrodollars might have confused them
20222,annoyed,I was trying to explain to them why the Great Recession was caused by the recycling of petrodollars and an unrestrained financial market 
20229,angry,Did they grow out of last years
20230,angry,oh my lord  Kids  they can never make up their mind
20231,angry,Yes but she didnt like anything in the store We didnt even buy anything I was so upset
20232,angry,Four hours for nothing
20283,disgusted,Oh yuck What was it
20284,disgusted,Wonder how it got there
20285,disgusted,IT was a mouse so gross  I was traumatized for a week
20367,disgusted,That is disgusting  Sounds like my dad though  He keeps things for months
20368,disgusted,UGH thats bad  I bet is smelled like crap too
20369,disgusted,Yeah I was just lazy in cleaning stuff out but I  wont make that mistake again I dont like to throw up while Im cleaning 
20458,angry,did he get a beat down 
20459,angry,hah thats cool 
20460,angry,Yeah most definitely I used my belt 
20501,annoyed,OH my  does she ever give it back  Is it alot of money
20502,annoyed,Its hard to refuse family  But sometimes that can be taken advantage of
20503,annoyed,Sometimes it is a lot and she never pays on time I eep saying I am going to stop loaning to her but she is my sister
20504,annoyed,That is so true
20532,angry,how did you respond
20533,angry,thats probaby a smart choice
20534,angry,Well I thought about honking but decided against it and just sat there frustrated
20611,angry,I see is that a good thing or bad thing for you
20612,angry,Sorry to hear that Well yeah maybe its for the best
20613,angry,Maybe a good thing We break up so much lol
20614,angry,Yeah I think we should just call it quits now
20709,disgusted,Oh thats disappointing What was wrong with it
20710,disgusted,Ewwwwwwwthe devils topping Did you send it back 
20711,disgusted,I asked for no black olives and tehy were everywhere
20712,disgusted,No They did give me a refund though
20722,angry,Oh no Ive done that before  Did you call them and ask for a grace period so you didnt build fines  We all make mistakes like that so dont beat yourself up
20723,angry,Those kinds of things are part of life and its better for our minds if we let them go and move on or see the humor in it  I hope it didnt hurt your standing with the company  You just reminded me to pay my internet bill thanks
20724,angry,I did I still felt bad though
20779,angry,Ugh Thats the worst Have you called himher 
20780,angry,Thats so frustrating Ask for a break on the rent next month
20781,angry,Yes It has been a week We couldnt male our homemade pizzas like we do every saturday
20782,angry,That sounds like a plan
20783,angry,im sorry to hear that  whant happened 
20784,angry,always believe in yourself and dont let others opinions dictate your feelings 
20785,angry,Well I was telling him about my job and he sad that I was to stupid to do my job right
20835,annoyed,That sucks Did you reschedule
20836,annoyed,I hate when that happens Especially when the same people do it over and over
20837,annoyed,Not yet I hope we do
20838,angry,Why would she do that
20839,angry,That is sad
20840,angry,I dont know She knows he is no good He will just hurt her again because she allows it Its sad
20848,disgusted,That is terrible 
20849,disgusted,I dont know They should be locked up though Hurting a person is next
20850,disgusted,It really is what possesses someone to do that
20871,angry,Did they have a good reason
20872,angry,Well maybe you can reschedule and do something even more fun
20873,angry,None that they told me
20874,angry,I am sorry how important were they
20875,angry,I am sorry that sounds stressful
20876,angry,I have to turn them into the school tomorrow Now I will be late for work because I have to do new ones at the school in the morning
20877,angry,I hate being late but I have to get the papers in
20911,disgusted,I bet that was disgusting I would bring a noseplug from now on
20912,disgusted,I love hiking I cant imagine happening upon something so gross Would probably ruin my hike as well
20913,disgusted,I actually had to hold my nose and run off Almost ruined my hike
20923,disgusted,The snails Yikes Well Ive always thought it probably gets a worse rap than it actually should and probably doesnt taste that bad Half of why I think its probably gross is simply because they made it seem gross in old cartoons So how did it taste
20924,disgusted,Yeah thats true Especially since you were on a cruise it sounds like its all a part of the experience At least you can say you didnt chicken out Im glad you decided to go that way because now you have a special memory tied to that vacation
20925,disgusted,Everyone else was trying it so I did too It was terrible but I can now say I did it
20968,disgusted,Wow thats really frustrating 
20969,disgusted,Oh yuck That is so gross
20970,disgusted,It was more than that it was horrifying  I have never seen anything more disturbing in my life  The toilet was overflowing onto the floor
20983,angry,Just try and teach them to be more careful with them
20984,angry,I am sure it will get beter
20985,angry,Yeah its hard since I feel like what Im trying to communicate to them isnt getting through They repeat the same thing a dozen timesand then maybe they start making some progress Its hard for me to see them run into the same wall over and over so to speak But youre right
21013,annoyed,I hate when those come around
21014,annoyed,I am sure it will soon
21015,annoyed,They take forever to go away
21056,angry,Oh no Thats not good at all Its hard to diagnose things sometimes
21057,angry,Well Im glad he got some antibiotics for it I hope that helped enough
21058,angry,Well after a few days of getting worse took him to his primary dr  He gave antibiotics for a sore throat
21059,angry,Nope  Got worse went to an ENT and finally got the correct antibiotics  ER bill Dr bill and ENT bill for what started as a simple sore throat
21069,disgusted,That sure is embarrassing did he get talked to about his behavior 
21070,disgusted,I agree at that age kids should definitely know better and think before doing something Unbelievable 
21071,disgusted,No His parents werent there to hear it or witness it I didnt feel like ratting him out or dealing with it either Kind of lazy on my part Everyone just kind of shrugged it off and laughed awkwardly but you could tell everyone was thinking Really Why
21112,angry,That would really anger me as well  What did you do  Did you find the person who did it
21113,angry,Yeah it blows my mind that people think they can damage other peoples belonging and just go about their day  
21114,angry,no i didnt find them sucks that people dont care about other peoples property
21145,annoyed,I hate that Thats one of my biggest pet peeves Thats such an awkward situation because you dont want to come off as high maintenance and ask them to stop but itd be so easy for them to have better manners too I wish I had better advice Maybe go to HR
21146,annoyed,Yeah absolutely Thats what I meant earlier too about being high maintenance I dont know maybe earbuds But Im sure youve tried that Who knows how they would respond if you asked them personally and if they actually did improve theyd probably just forget and revert back in a few days anyway
21147,annoyed,I could go to HR but I dont want to be that guy if you know what I mean
21173,angry,Oh no I hate when that happens hopefully your computers holds on a little longer for it to go back down
21174,angry,Well good luck I know how frustrating that can be
21175,angry,I hope so too I might have to just end up buying it My hard drive is getting pretty old and running slow
21176,annoyed,Wow why are they still shooting off fireworks Dont they know its a one day holiday
21177,annoyed,I agree It must be hard to get any sleep I feel bad for any animals in the area too
21178,annoyed,I mean a few days before and after is fine but a whole month  That is pretty inconsiderate of your neighbors
21195,angry,Where were you at Why couldnt you go home Sounds frustrating
21196,angry,Oh that is frustrating I bet you were very annoyed
21197,angry,because there was still too much work left to do
21219,angry,That would make me mad Did you know who did it
21220,angry,Thats too bad Maybe they could check security cameras for you
21221,angry,no i was at the store for a few hours so i wasnt able to catch the person
21271,angry,That is unfortunate Did they reschedule the picnic
21272,angry,Im glad you feel better knowing that it will happen next week
21273,angry,Yes we will try again next week I was mad about it but now I feel okay
21315,angry,Wow im sorry to hear that It sucks when something goes wrong at a job youve been there long
21316,angry,Im glad you found a job quick That must have felt a little good to tell them at least
21317,angry,I know  I worked my tail off for that company  After I was fired they called me a week later to tell me they realized it wasnt my fault but I had already found a new job and told them to take a hike
21433,disgusted,I just almost threw up a bit when you described it to me  So I understand
21434,disgusted,I cannot imagine anyone wanting to drink that without losing a bet
21435,disgusted,oh man it was so nasty  i did not think that was a thing 
21436,angry,Ugh I hate crap like that  Why cant credit be shared  Does it always have to be so cutthroat
21437,angry,Well Alls well that ends well  Im sure glad they were able to see through such a cheap ploy
21438,angry,Hey people get what the deserve in this world sometimes  Just be glad justice is served
21439,angry,Honestly Im indifferent as to how its shared Later my boss actually sat me down and told me they knew my colleague was out of line Ironically their contract with our company was up two weeks later and they werent renewed 
21440,angry,It is what it is I would never wish for anyone to lose their job but I am thankful that in the end I was able to stay in the good graces of senior leadership
21441,angry,For sure I appreciate the support Professionalism is tantamount
21445,annoyed,What did they do this time Kids are always getting into stuff
21446,annoyed,Those bums Maybe then need to be reminded who is the boss
21447,annoyed,They never go to bed at a decent time I cant get any sleep and am always rushing for work in the morning
21448,annoyed,We will all be bums if I lose my job
21452,disgusted,Oh no I can imagine how you must have felt when you realized  Did you get sick
21453,disgusted,I can understand that too  Did you double check the bread before the next sandwich
21454,disgusted,It didnt make me sick but it definitely made me FEEL sick for a short period I guess mostly mental
21459,angry,Thats terrible Was anyone hurt
21460,angry,Youre lucky That could have been really bad Did he stop
21461,angry,He shouldnt have a license
21462,angry,No luckily I swerved into the outermost lane and there wasnt a car there Thank God
21463,angry,Nope just kept going like nothing happened
21486,annoyed,I have never heard of silverfish but if you have to hire an exterminator that sounds serious I hope you are ok
21487,annoyed,That is really annoying to hear I would be so furious if I was in your position
21488,annoyed,They are bugs that get everywhere in the house  I am pretty hacked off at the exterminator for not doing his job right
21489,annoyed,Wow that is a long time Why is it taking so long
21490,annoyed,That is pretty annoying for sure I hope they get moved in so they stop bothering you
21491,annoyed,I dont know but they bring in furniture almost every day And they do it late at night It
21492,annoyed,ME too That apartment isnt that darn big
21496,angry,Thats no good  What did he do
21497,angry,That is so annoying  Have you reported him or asked him to be sure to close the mailbox
21498,angry,He never closes the mailbox Sometimes my mail flies away
21499,angry,I told him and it changed nothing I could lose something important
21536,angry,True i think the store should introduce some policies for punishing such individuals with fines
21537,angry,Excellent When i was visiting Turkey they had the same thing for carts used to carry your luggage
21538,angry,Aldi has the right idea You pay a quarter to get a cart and only get your quarter back if you return it
21575,disgusted,I have never had that We dont have them here Good thing though lol
21576,disgusted,I would have done the same
21577,disgusted,Yeah last time Ill be back there I was so turned off I skipped dinner completely
21578,disgusted,Did you tell him anything
21579,disgusted,Well its his driveway I guess
21580,disgusted,I saw it from the window and decided not to yell from a distance like an uncivilized
21608,annoyed,Oh Ive been there I looked like a person who cut when I used to give a lot of cat baths Did you clean it right away cat scratch fever
21609,annoyed,It isnt too bad mild cold symptoms usually for a few days I hope its ok Do you cut his nails or put nail caps on Good for bath time
21610,annoyed,I did I was afraid it might have something in it as he tends to run around outside a lot Thats all I need lol
21618,angry,What do you mean by that
21619,angry,Those people need to find something better to do with their time Get a hobby people
21620,angry,You know those people who are just miserable and in a bad complaining mood and they hate it when youre happy and just want to be mean
21651,annoyed,You have a pet duck Thats nuts
21652,annoyed,What sort of things do you feed him
21653,annoyed,Not at all They are lovely critters But he is just a bit of a fatty boy and likes his food He is lovely and so sweet I protect all animals 
21654,annoyed,He has duck food and also greens veggies and fruit He just likes his food a little too much
21701,angry,I know the feeling
21702,angry,Well they are the one that has to deal with the consequences mostly i guess
21703,angry,Right They continue to listen and do things but none of it is doing anything because its all a show
21778,angry,I bet it did
21779,angry,That is understandable I have to catch myself sometimes when my kids are in the car
21780,angry,If people were just more considerate of the other people around them
21781,angry,That is so true
21782,angry,I get pretty bad road rage when my life is threatened
21783,angry,I hear that Its hard sometimes
21784,angry,People are just rude nowadays
21785,disgusted,Congrats How is it going
21786,disgusted,That seems very trivial but do you mean that he still doesnt seem to know you
21787,disgusted,Have you tried counseling reading going through a program Are there good things I know it is hard when a partner doesnt work on a relationship and keep it good
21788,disgusted,For sure but no relationship is perfect and everything takes work
21789,disgusted,I think Im going to break up with him Nine years and last week he ordered a pizza for us covered in black olives
21790,disgusted,Exactly I realized yesterday he does that all the time 
21791,disgusted,Nine years He should know already
21822,angry,Did you already make plans

21910,disgusted,How did they put it there nevermind Its just too much
21911,disgusted,You should still get one
21912,disgusted,Its so gross
21913,disgusted,I dont want to know either but I did wish I had a camera doorbell so I could see just who did it and speak to their parents
21952,angry,Are you talking about ones that just raise and raise prices
21953,angry,And they always get nasty with you like it was your fault and not theirs I feel you
21954,angry,No ones that dont stand behind their products and services  When I get a product it should work right or they should replace it Or when they make a mistake like charging you twice
21964,angry,Oh man I would have been so made did you say anything to them
21965,angry,Some people on think about themselves I would have said something if he didnt look the fighting type 
21966,angry,No I didnt because I avoid drama but my facial expression said it all On top of that I had a fussy baby with me the nerve of ppl

22057,annoyed,I am confident that you will
22058,annoyed,That is for sure maybe I can find a good one soon

22204,annoyed,Oh no That sounds so irritating Have you tried talking to your boss about him
22205,annoyed,Thats understandable He sounds clueless Ive had many coworkers like that and the best way Ive found to deal with them is run away as much as possible
22206,annoyed,No I dont want to cause drama  I just would have thought that he would get the hint when I dont answer him and act really busy
22216,disgusted,That is terrible Did you get it off
22217,disgusted,Man i would get new shoes
22218,disgusted,As much as I could  Theres still some stuck in the treads on my shoe
22219,disgusted,They are new shoes 
22229,angry,Is the boss aware or does he seem to skate by unnoticed 
22230,angry,Is there an HR department you can take it to
22231,angry,Sounds like it might be time to sit down with the boss and discuss your thoughts and feelings If moral gets too low its not good for anybody
22232,angry,she is aware but doesnt feel the need to do anything about it thats what makes it worse
22233,angry,not directly inhouse
22234,angry,ive tried she says she will talk to him but nothing changes
22247,angry,I would have slapped him so fast
22248,angry,I would have just as mad as you are
22249,angry,I was so upset at him
22288,angry,Do you want to yell at him and call him a liar
22289,angry,One time i secretly called my bosss wife and outted him for an affair he was having with one of my coworkers lol he never knew

22380,disgusted,That isnt good What did you do when you stepped in the poop
22381,disgusted,Did you throw the sandals away or just clean them
22382,disgusted,I went right home and took a shower because I was wearing sandals
22422,disgusted,Oh no That sounds awful What a kind thing to do though Im sure they were very grateful for your help
22423,disgusted,I hope you took the right precautions not to get it yourself I can only imagine that I have never had it and never want to
22424,disgusted,i tried to stay positive and see the bright side of it but boy was i itchy afterward
22425,disgusted,i have really long hair so it would be torture
22467,disgusted,I see that more in the country I guess That would be horrifying But maybe he is just immune to pain
22468,disgusted,Sounds like he was ok Ive had injuries before and they werent serious enough or worth the hassle of the emergency room But he still had to take a trip to go somewhere Dont be afraid to care though  One person is all that is needed Kindness is always good
22469,disgusted,I dont know Hard to tell if he was homeless or not I felt bad for him but I mean I didnt really have much to help him with Hell I dont even have health insurance myself haha So since no one else reacted I decided I shouldnt either
22531,disgusted,Lol Did you dare look inside
22532,disgusted,That is bad  I  always try to remember how long stuff has been in there but sometimes things hide on you in there
22533,disgusted,yes  The disgusting part was I couldnt tell what it was
22598,annoyed,Did you ask the kid or the kids parents to stop kicking your chair
22599,annoyed,How long was the flight you were on

22727,angry,I asked my mother where she left my drawing she said she threw it out
22728,angry,I was younger and i spent all day
22739,disgusted,That is awful I would definitely not pay and never go back again
22740,disgusted,They will lose a lot of business over that one Word of mouth is the best way to hurt someone That is gross and I wouldnt go back either
22741,disgusted,They offered both of us money back and free meals for next time but we are never going back  It turned me off of mexican food which is a shame because its my favorite
22801,angry,wow thats a huge pain

22872,annoyed,That is irritating huh  It is like a kid that cant stand not having the attention for a minute so they act up  Haha
22873,annoyed,It just wants you off the phone instead  
22874,annoyed,Yes I try to get him to go outside but he never wants to

22885,annoyed,Oh no What did he do
22886,annoyed,Yes little brothers can sometimes be irritating  Maybe ask him next time to turn it down
22887,annoyed,My little brother always plays electric guitar And thats too irritating
22888,annoyed,Yes You are right
22922,annoyed,I would not want to be in your position its ok to help but all the time it can be dreadful 
22923,annoyed,It will get better put your foot down and maybe say no in a nice way to not step on any ones toes

22936,disgusted,It looked and smelled really gross
22937,angry,I would be mad Did she say why she didnt bring you anything
22938,angry,Maybe you could talk to her after you calm down a bit  Im sure there is a reason
22939,angry,She must be mad about something she always at least asks if I want anything
22945,angry,That sounds really frustrating Who mows their lawn that early holy cow
22946,angry,Wow I would be mad to 
22947,angry,I have no idea I was pissed because I went to ask him to stop and he just ignored me
22968,angry,Oh boy  Thats no good  Did the credit card company alert you or did they miss it too
22969,angry,I bet  I cant believe they didnt alert you  Were they able to take care of it for you and suspend the charges and the account
22970,angry,They missed it  I am so upset that it happened
22980,angry,You shouldnt let those kind of people upset you
22981,angry,Maybe you should move out Have you thought about that
22982,angry,Thats hard to do if you live with them lol I get that we all can once in awhilebut incessantly day in and out no matter WHAT way things goso either way Thats a problem
22983,angry,Its my house why would I move out

23010,annoyed,YES i just want to see my own friends and not have to take care of him for once
23046,angry,That is disappointing Did you confront them about it I am sorry you have to deal with that
23047,angry,Thats too bad Lesson learned I guess
23048,angry,Not really I hate confrontation And nothing really of cost was lost Ill just lose time in cleaning up after them It definitely is a learning experience when it comes to trust Doubt Ill be an AirBnB host any time soon

31135,disgusted,Oh I understand Have you talked to her about how you feel about it
31136,disgusted,No she was not She was just behaving very irresponsibly It is not the first time happening though
31179,annoyed,I think its about time you lay down some rules
31180,annoyed,Is this a roommate situation or are we talking about kids 
31181,annoyed,No one will even help keep it clean by picking up after themselves They have undone all the work I did by leaving messes everywhere
31204,angry,That would take such toll one me Just make sure they have enough to keep them occupied maybe
31205,angry,Might have to bring them to the park and tire them out School should starting up soon
31206,angry,Yes its been rough  I have a ton of work to do for my day job working from home mostly this summer and other stressful things going on so Im not doing a great job of keeping them entertained

31218,annoyed,No I would never want to be They are too corrupt here My neighbor has not come out of his house or let his dogs out in days I am sure they wont do anything They dont even show for gun shotsrapebeatings etc

31223,angry,Oh god I would be SO TICKED Do they have cameras
31224,angry,That is AWFUL My mom had that happen too An old guy hit her atthe gas station and sped off Seriously not fair
31225,angry,They did have cameras but they were not working that day and the person did not leave a note
31226,disgusted,Oh man that sounds horrible I would probably faint
31227,disgusted,It must have hurt so much 
31228,disgusted,I almost did actually  I had to just look away and pretend nothing happened
31266,angry,What
31267,angry,Maybe she has too much on her plate
31268,angry,i gave a subordinate a project but she blatanatly declined
31277,annoyed,Thats annoying So does it still work and its just hard to use or does it just do nothing in general Deals are always tricky like that as sometimes theyre too good to be true
31278,annoyed,Yeah especially since customer service is usually where companies skimp and dont try to hire or train employees very well Well I hope it has a good resolution in the end and something works out in your favor Im a clean freak so Id hate to not be able to clean properly when I wanted or needed to
31279,annoyed,I am not keeping something broken I really needed a vacuum days ago though So that was really irritating Dealing with the CS took awhile and was a pain
31280,annoyed,Well I am waiting until tomorrow now for a vacuum because I dont want to talk to anymore CS but its ALSO annoying that I have to wait for my refund  Yes I needed a vacuum days ago and this wasnt a new oneso it was supposed to be inspected I avoid CS like the plague and YEP they do outsource to other countries where the people can be very rude
31284,disgusted,Oh gross  They should have street cleaners taking care of that  Poor animal  
31285,disgusted,I bet  I have never seen one up close so that turns my stomach too  I cant stand seeing injured hurt or dead animals Hope youre feeling better now
31286,disgusted,I was sick to my stomache when I saw it
31429,angry,The quality of driving is going down and down
31430,angry,Yeah I agree weve have to drive carefully
31431,angry,It is and soon it will be very unsafe on the roads
31458,angry,Oh no did you get angry with him
31459,angry,Thats a fair punishment they have to learn somehow
31460,angry,Yes I made him apologize and stay in his room with no toys for an hour
31461,angry,They really do I should have grounded him even
31496,disgusted,I havent though Ive stepped in other poo  Is it similar to others
31497,disgusted,Dog mostly cat once or twice  Possibly human but Id rather not think too hard on that
31498,disgusted,Yes a little bit What types of poo have you stepped in
31569,disgusted,Well thats unfortunate Do you think the party will be fun
31570,disgusted,Oh that sucks I hope you guys can work it out
31571,disgusted,No not after i got irritated by him
31603,annoyed,How many do you get per day
31604,annoyed,Should be ending soon and you can go back to your normal life without those pesky calls
31605,annoyed,Some days I get 3 or 4 I dont even know how they got my number Ill be so glad when election season is over
31627,angry,Could you fight them more for the refund
31628,angry,I am sure I hope you can get a resolution
31629,angry,it got me screaming at such insensitivity
31660,angry,They should be required to pay you for that  They would charge you if you tried to cancel that close to the appointment time  So annoying  Did they give you a reason
31661,angry,Ridiculous  Doctors think that they are above everyone else and it drives me crazy
31662,angry,I agree No reason And now I have to wait another two weeks for a new appointment Im so mad
31684,disgusted,Im right there with you I hate pineapple on pizza it doesnt belong
31685,disgusted,It throws off the flavor of pizza completely
31686,disgusted,Right Its so gross
31693,annoyed,thats unfortunate maybe she will learn eventually though
31694,annoyed,she will be fine then
31695,annoyed,Yeah its really annoying hopefully she will she is still a puppy
31725,disgusted,Was it yours
31726,disgusted,Eww Im sorry about that That would have ruined my lunch quickly
31727,disgusted,No thats what makes it so gross  Must have been a workers
31734,angry,Oh no Sorry to hear that Can you get it fixed
31735,angry,Wow thats expensive I hope you can find a reasonable used car
31736,angry,I can but they said it will cost at least 2000 dollars for it to be replaced  Might have to buy a new used car
31786,annoyed,I HATE when that happens In my case it was a dog I caught him on camera Maybe you should invest in a security cam
31787,annoyed,I hear if you sprinkle red pepper all over your trash area it can help ward off some animals
31788,annoyed,I was thinking of that because having to clean up the mess every time is ridiculous Ive already tried repellents but only natural ones since I dont like spraying chemicals  I will have to price out some cameras
31886,disgusted,Haha  I know exactly what you are talking about  I love that show and yes it is quite gross  You must have felt quite disgusted
31887,disgusted,Ooo  Yuck  I hope you dont get nightmares from it

31891,disgusted,I was shopping and had to use the bathroom but when I went in someone had had an accident  It was a mess and smelled horrible  It was so gross and i thought i was going to be sick
31896,annoyed,that is awful why did he do that
31897,annoyed,did you tell him the truth
31898,annoyed,dont know why
31932,angry,Ugh Those are the worst
31933,angry,I wish people could be more considerate on the road Its so annoying
31934,angry,Yeah Someone actually cut me off
31968,angry,Thats no fun  How long did they have you waiting
31969,angry,Dont be too angry  They might just have been swamped with prescriptions to fill
31970,angry,It was over 20 minutes
31993,annoyed,Bosses are sometimes unaware it seems
31994,annoyed,I would hate working there
31995,annoyed,He is totally oblivious to the fact that we are so busy  It drives me insane
32015,annoyed,I believe that was me

32050,angry,Yeah I mean Im glad theyre having fun but the constant screaminglike why are they even screaming
32078,angry,What kind of work is it
32079,angry,That does not sound fun at all
32080,angry,it is phone support so not fun at all
32106,annoyed,oh well that sucks It can be very aggravating to spend time working on something and then have it destroyed
32107,annoyed,Yes not only a waste of your time but the money No doubt very frustrating and Im sure you wanted to teach the dog a lesson 
32108,annoyed,Yeah I had it fenced up for a couple weeks till I thought it was good the first day I take it down wasted
32118,disgusted,5
32119,disgusted,ah it happens lol

32121,disgusted,The food was cold and gross and had a hair in it
32149,annoyed,Was traffic particulary bad this morning
32150,annoyed,Ugh I hate when traffic is like that  We live near Atlanta and its always so bad
32151,annoyed,It was real bad

32158,angry,Which will hopefully be a real estate broker in Florida
32195,disgusted,That is so gross and rude
32196,disgusted,I guess that is a no
32197,disgusted,I know  I was wondering if anyone had ever taught them to cover their mouthI guess not
32201,annoyed,Did you check the last place you had it
32202,annoyed,Oh thats lame He should have checked for you
32203,annoyed,yes I am pretty sure I left it in my boyfriends car but he says its probably not in there and he wont look
32257,angry,How did they do that

32260,angry,A family member

32348,annoyed,THats terrible did they not have enough open
32349,annoyed,Never good makes them look bad to the customers
32350,annoyed,They did not
32351,annoyed,I do agree with that
32352,angry,I hate government officials like that
32353,angry,Too much as well
32354,angry,Me too Some of them are just getting paid for doing nothing
32376,disgusted,I always hate seeing any kind of animal on the side of the road
32377,disgusted,The worst is seeing something that looks like one of your pets too Always fear for a break out at home 
32378,disgusted,Yeah me too

34391,disgusted,Good They dont deserve your business You should report it to the department of health too
34392,disgusted,I left immediately I was so disguted
34399,angry,She shouldnt have done that without asking you But maybe there is an opportunity here for you
34400,angry,Maybe you can experiment with other women with your wife Could be fun
34401,angry,What sort of opportunity do you see Im not sure if I want to divorce her
34411,annoyed,Did you catch them doing it
34412,annoyed,I would be upset if that happened to me too

34426,angry,That is terrible Did you tried calling him
34427,angry,That is very bad person You should forget about him
34428,angry,I did try calling him He kept telling me that he was on the way I think he was still at home the whole time thogh
34444,annoyed,Yes that is incredibly annoying Im a quiet person by nature so that can drive me carzy quite fast
34445,annoyed,Yes I feel like yelling at them  But thats just something that I would never actually be able to do
34446,annoyed,i want to tell them to stop but dont
34457,angry,What Did they steal anything

34580,angry,Thank goodness for that 
34581,angry,So then what did you do
34582,angry,Yeah thats pretty crappy for sure
34583,angry,I had to go back to my current company and ask for my job back They had already posted my position so it caused some issues but they were glad to keep me 
34584,angry,I know I felt lucky And get this a few days after they pulled my job offer they called me back and said they had changed their minds
34585,angry,I told them professionally of course that they could shove that job in their rump
34667,disgusted,Are you ok
34668,disgusted,I bet That always happens to me At least its gone now for you
34669,disgusted,I am good now but it felt pretty sick at the time
34699,angry,Yes the cable company is infuriating Do they eventually help you though
34700,angry,Thats awful  That definitely is the worst  Maybe its time to change companies
34701,angry,Nope Thats the worst part I kept getting transferred then got disconnected Theyre the worst
34717,angry,Oh wow why would she think you stole the money
34718,angry,Would she have any reason not to trust you  I would assume you have not done anything like this before
34719,angry,Because she can not find it she is the one that misplaced it I am so furious right now I would never do that
34723,annoyed,Could you purchase one from a local store
34724,annoyed,I see online is such a convenience but if things get delayed or dont work it becomes an issue
34725,annoyed,I could but it would be twice as expensive I prefer buying things online as its less of a hassle to return them if something is wrong I dont have to drive anywhere
34726,annoyed,True But I rarely have that happen It was a bummer it was on a big purchase though
34740,annoyed,Did your boss understand at least
34741,annoyed,Thats true I would be mad about that as well
34742,annoyed,She did but it was still really frustrating
34775,annoyed,So annoying Where were their parents
34776,annoyed,What a pain in the you know what I wish the parents could be punished too Haha
34777,annoyed,They were just standing there watching I wish people could control their kids better
34830,disgusted,Ugh that sounds really unpleasant  Do not want lol
34831,disgusted,Sometimes I want to be like you are not discreet
34832,disgusted,it was so obvious what he was doing
34840,angry,That is horrible
34841,angry,It was just a tire he couldve let it go
34842,angry,i wanted to say something but it happened so quick and the dude was jacked so i let it go
34850,disgusted,Wow how that happened
34851,disgusted,That is terrible What did you do then
34852,disgusted,He jumped off of a swing and landed wrong I was sick to my stomach when I witnessed it 
34892,angry,Oh no did you file a police report
34893,angry,That is good glad it will get taken care of
34894,angry,No I didnt but I reached out to their insurance and hes going to be paying for it 
34907,annoyed,That can definitely get aggravating It always seems to happen at the worst time
34908,annoyed,I understand maybe you can set up certain times or something
34909,annoyed,specially in the summer months
34958,annoyed,Thats terrible can you reprint them

35001,angry,I would be too  Im happy you didnt get into an accident or even worse killed
35002,angry,I did because they almost swerved into me and killed me I was so mad
35070,annoyed,OMG I know Its impossible to sleep  Im sorry that happened to you
35071,annoyed,Those scoundrels How can they get away with that

35082,angry,Yeah I have been on the phone with them all day  They said it was part of the contract
35083,angry,Im definitely planning to
35113,disgusted,wow that is embarassing for them maybe they had a crazy night and had no time to shower
35114,disgusted,oh gosh that is awful sounds like depression
35115,disgusted,It was horrible  It had to have been from not bathing for quite some time
35123,annoyed,Ouch Are you okay
35124,annoyed,Im so sorry
35125,annoyed,yea just a tad mad about it
35144,annoyed,That sucks if it had been in the coffee shop maybe it could have been replaced

35146,annoyed,I was already five blocks away I had to drink the gross coffee at the office I usually dont buy coffee so I was trying to treat myself 
35188,annoyed,Im sorry to hear that Have you called IT
35189,annoyed,Maybe its time for a new printer

35222,disgusted,Oh my gosh thats disgusting I hate when there are flying things buzzing around Soo annoying
35223,disgusted,Seriously I wonder where those babies would have been laid You probably saved someones lunch from being a birthing suite
35224,disgusted,I let it make me much more annoyed than it should have to the point where I was snapping at other people unnecessarily just because of how mad it was making me But yeah not gonna lie felt a little satisfied too that I prevented it from creating more little nuissances
35267,disgusted,Ew what did you do
35268,disgusted,Aw thats disappointing

35314,disgusted,It was catered lunch So on refunds 
35356,disgusted,That is a very big problem to me However if you signed a new lease with him it seems as if you can deal with it right
35357,disgusted,Well it seems that you have to deal with him for at least another year With that in mind I hope you have more than one bathroom I suggest you let him keep his poop in one without cleaning it up until it starts to bother him
35358,disgusted,Yeah I guess I mean its much more annoying to me to have to do another roommate search Searching for roommates and apartments in general is just so annoying and Id rather spend the time trying to make money for rent and all that But yeah not sure why some people have these kind of quirks
35414,annoyed,Oh man mine too Its so annoying
35415,annoyed,Sure does I think they get a little jealous and just want our attention Theyre also very curious about the world which is a good thing
35416,annoyed,The most question are asked when Im talking to someone else does that happen to you too
35417,annoyed,Thats all true

35482,angry,Lol I shouldve done that Anything to show my extreme displeasure I live in a big city so bad drivers are everywhere
35510,angry,Thats going to be a pain to fix yourself
35511,angry,That was really shady of them to do that wonder why they did
35512,angry,Im more upset at the fact that they lied about having insurance
35776,annoyed,I bet she was really happy about that 
35777,annoyed,Yikes that would drive me crazy
35778,annoyed,It would drive me crazy also she should be more considerate 
35779,annoyed,Maybe she will start paying on time
35780,annoyed,she was but I am not I think she has paid on time maybe twice in two years

35795,angry,That is terrible if he blamed you
35796,angry,He also wasted 30 minutes of my time and his own and did it out of spite I think so Some people just like to be miserable and blame others
35833,disgusted,Why is that
35834,disgusted,I get that I guess you can just bring cleaning supplies
35835,disgusted,some people are just so nasty

35852,disgusted,Sounds like a mess were they punished in some way 
35853,disgusted,Sorry ruin They simply decided they would not do the project according to instructions and just wanted to give me a hard time and ruin the time we had to work on it

36240,angry,That makes a lot of sense I wouldnt be happy either I hope that they have good insurance
36241,angry,Wow Thats aweful Is your mom ok

38466,angry,Thats the thing I havent bathed in two days and its making me angry
38503,disgusted,Thats great I bet you love that
38504,disgusted,Haha well dogs do that I highly recommend not letting the puppy lick your face while its young
38505,disgusted,I did until I noticed that when I took him outside to go to the bathroom he was eating the neighbor dogs doo doo
38518,annoyed,Why are people so inconsiderate Are you ok
38519,annoyed,Yea its not enough that you drive safe sometimes
38520,annoyed,Yes I had to slam on my breaks but Im fine its quite annoying I dont know why people do it
38539,annoyed,That would be so annoying
38540,annoyed,I dont blame you for that I would do the same
38541,annoyed,I was not happy to say the least  Next time I will just take it to the car wash rather that waste my free time
38587,annoyed,That really stinks Maybe  you both can take some time off of work and be together
38588,annoyed,Well you should sit down with him and have a talk with him about it 
38589,annoyed,Well lately he has been taking his time getting home and its making me late
38596,angry,ooooh I would be too  I had someone dent my car too last week  I feel your pain
38597,angry,Nope  Try paintless dent repair Its not too pricey and quick fix
38598,angry,yea  people dont care about other peoples property anymore
38618,annoyed,Why What was going on
38619,annoyed,Thats disappointing 
38620,annoyed,too much work to have time off approved 
38671,annoyed,thats awesome how long did that take
38672,annoyed,yea i can understand that
38673,annoyed,Over an hour  but in this heat it makes it very exhausting
38674,annoyed,It was perfect timing I was almost done and it started raining
38700,disgusted,did you throw him out
38701,disgusted,did it work
38702,disgusted,I couldnt  didnt have the heart I tried to push his head out the window as best I could
38707,angry,That would be annoying If there is anybody over him you might try reporting it first
38708,angry,Lol  Maybe you could ask for another department
38709,angry,Ill try that first but its hard to report someone for just being really terrible in general
38731,annoyed,Car door
38732,annoyed,When did that happen
38733,annoyed,yea
38818,angry,That sounds really great and delicious 
38819,angry,Ohhhhhh yeah thats no good Still that happens to me all the time so I wouldnt worry too much about it 
38820,angry,Yeah it would have been if I hadnt burned it to a crisp and turned it into a black charred piece of leather
38824,disgusted,who did they leave and where
38825,disgusted,wow thats crazy
38826,disgusted,Sorry My friends wife left him in the middle the night It made me sick
38827,annoyed,Oh no I hate that
38828,annoyed,Maybe he comes back or you find him
38829,annoyed,yea he gone
38855,angry,it made him a ton of money so i think thats all that mattered to him at that point cause i agree it was crap
38856,angry,that was back then when he was trying to do something great the drive isnt there when you have already done it
38857,angry,I dont know I like to think he is better than that 
38864,annoyed,i get that i am in pain every morning and get up and go to work everyday so its hard to find sympathy from me
38865,annoyed,exactly it really drives me nuts when people feel like they entitled to this or that
38866,annoyed,My point exactly  Youre a hard worker despite your physical pains  I was born in a third world country and am now selfemployed with full financial autonomy my own car apartment and supportive friends and familyDONT TELL ME you cant fix your life You just dont want it bad enough
38917,angry,Do you know how it happened
38918,angry,That sucks I hate people who do stuff like that and dont take responsibility
38919,angry,nah it was while i was at walmart
38929,disgusted,That poor dog
38930,disgusted,That all sounds horrible
38931,disgusted,I know right I cant find out who had her but it was someone near me as she was running 2 weeks ago like a demon was after her and almost got hit No way she was loose for any amount of time but right that moment
38932,annoyed,Did they just not care
38933,annoyed,Sometimes they are tired at the end of their shift It happens
38934,annoyed,I think so that must be the case
38939,angry,Why is he missing and is he home
38940,angry,Oh god some dogs have to be watched a lot Watch the shelters and put up flyers everywhere online
38941,angry,he dug a hole and got out of the backyard and has not returned
38977,angry,Some drunks are funny and some are unfortunately annoying as hell
38978,angry,Oh man all your friends are the annoying drunks
38979,angry,Yeah I wish they were funny
39019,angry,Some people dont realize its just as easy as being comfortable being yourself to be accepted
39020,angry,Are you gonna have to see this person again
39021,angry,Exactly
39038,angry,I have heard that a lot today How did yours get out
39039,angry,Ah Have you put up flyers etc

39072,disgusted,Do you mean the biology class was taken at a school
39073,disgusted,Wow That is pretty amazing Did you enjoy it
39074,disgusted,Yes we did it at home  She had to dissect several things and I could not watch it  She had to do it with my husband instead
39126,disgusted,so do you wait till you are back at home
39127,disgusted,yea thats understandable 
39128,disgusted,i try sometimes i cant help it and i have to and goodness it was awful
39129,disgusted,its like man if you are going to the bathroom please use spray
39166,angry,I hate that Work is never fun on the weekends
39167,angry,That sounds very painful
39168,angry,yea and it always seems to go by so slowly
39197,angry,No not if he is being loud and rude that is never okay
39198,angry,I guess he has no care for anyone but himself
39199,angry,They are very strange I dont understand that selfishness People work all different days and hours Of course he doesnt have the nerve to go yell at the people who set off fireworks all night after 10 
39200,annoyed,did he get a beat down
39201,annoyed,ah well in that case thats a good move
39202,annoyed,No hes my right hand man so I had to let it slide
39218,annoyed,Were the people involved ok
39219,annoyed,Always that bad egg everywhere Its people like that that causes accidents
39220,annoyed,I think so there were just a lot of cars involved  But this crazy person decided he was more important than anyone else and zoomed up the emergency lane blocking the ambulance that was trying to get to the wreck
39240,annoyed,sounds like my wife
39241,annoyed,i set the clocks ahead in the house and in the car  it doesnt work all the time but it helps

39555,annoyed,I hope not I am leaving when my lease is up
39591,disgusted,Oh no  Did he get a tummy ache

39594,disgusted,I know right
39652,angry,who cut you

40088,disgusted,Oh noooo did it bring bugs too
40089,disgusted,Yuck I hope you get rid of them quick and easy
40090,disgusted,Yes there were flies all over my room
40098,angry,Wow What about her work
40099,angry,Thats too bad
40100,angry,I still cant understand how one can be so irresponsible and careless Just because of him both of our works had been given failed score
40104,angry,Im sorry Im sure something better will come along
40105,angry,Always be positive 
40106,angry,Yes I am sure of it I will find something eventually

40165,annoyed,So I can buy her dmb things she can decorate lol
40198,angry,That sounds so frustrating I cant stand messy people
40199,angry,Sounds like it Are you in a management position or something where you can say something to them
40200,angry,Same here Its like they dont care about anyone else but themselves
40201,angry,Unfortunately not but I plan to pass my concerns up the chain if it keeps up which it probably will
40240,disgusted,you should thrash in the waste bin
40241,disgusted,oh ok that good you took safety precaution and others from getting harm by doing that welldone
40242,disgusted,Yeah I had to dispose of it but wow was it gross
40271,angry,Have you thought about getting a second opinion
40272,angry,Perhaps you should get different insurance
40273,angry,Maybe but my insurance only covers so many places in my area
40274,angry,Right its that easy
40295,angry,I absolutely hate liars   Are you sure he is really a friend if he lied to you
40296,angry,Oh I see   I guess its kinda hard to give a friend you have a long time over a lie they told   Hopefully heshe had a good reason to tell the lie then
40297,angry,He is a friend i have for sometime now
40308,disgusted,What show was this on
40309,disgusted,It is so sad that he died
40310,disgusted,It was Anthony Bourdain Parts Unknown
40311,disgusted,Yeah  suprising too as he seemed to have his life on track after all his issuues when he was young
40354,disgusted,oh no why is that
40355,disgusted,i know right but what can we do he is the president 
40356,disgusted,He tweets about dumb stuff
40403,annoyed,CAn you not ask him not to
40404,annoyed,Could you hide the keys
40405,annoyed,Yea but he never listens
40412,angry,No  did you used to text while driving
40413,angry,But maybe some people arent as consientous as you and did get into accidents
40414,angry,Yes and I never got into any accidents
40418,angry,Are they going to pay for the repair
40419,angry,That stinks nothing you can do
40420,angry,it was in a store parking lot  dont even know who did it
40467,disgusted,Why not
40468,disgusted,Its not fair  but I suppose the opposite view is that if they make enough money then you dont need the support that otehr people do
40469,disgusted,If your parents make too much money you do not qualify
40514,disgusted,oh wow that is gross
40515,disgusted,yea i dont see why thats allowed on tv how is that not animal cruelty
40516,disgusted,Disgusting right It was wriggling in his mouth
40572,annoyed,Im sorry that happened
40573,annoyed,I hope it goes better next time
40574,annoyed,I sat by myself for 30 minutes I was not very happy by the end
40592,disgusted,Woah Really Thats weird
40593,disgusted,Maybe it tastes amazing though  well never know They put vinegar on ice cream in italy sometimes
40594,disgusted,Yeah it was really nasty
40654,disgusted,oh i heard about this earlier its still gross and i dont know why they showed that on tv
40655,disgusted,keep spreading the word
40656,disgusted,I know Ive been telling everyone about it
40657,disgusted,Dont worry I will
40667,disgusted,I cannot even imagine how horrible that must have been What did you do
40668,disgusted,LOLI think I would have still been showering
40669,disgusted,I took a shower I was so grossed out by it
40795,disgusted,Yuck that sounds really gross
40796,disgusted,Did you ask him why he did it
40797,disgusted,It really looked so gross
40831,annoyed,From your house
40832,annoyed,Why wouldnt he just go to the store and buy his own
40833,annoyed,Yeah I get so irritated when he does that
40843,disgusted,Ew That must have been so disgusting
40844,disgusted,It must have tasted even worse 
40845,disgusted,Yeah it looked pretty gross
40874,angry,I feel sorry for you how did you reacted 
40875,angry,This is normal maybe you should take so time alone to think about how you really fell about the situation Anger  can make you do things that you will regret later 
40876,angry,I was so angry but also so shocked that I didnt even know what to say to her
40889,angry,Oh that can be annoying I guess in her defence it was a Saturday night But still it doesnt take much effort to try to keep the noise down even if you do get in late I hope you were able to sleep okay 
40890,angry,Yeah like you suggest it is the little considerations of the other persons needs that can make the difference between an okay and a really good flatmate
40891,angry,Yeah I agree we both work shifts though so sometimes I have to work all of Saturday day and I always make sure to keep the noise down if shes had to work a Saturday Thank you
40934,annoyed,That must be so frustrating
40935,annoyed,Im sorry to hear that I hope he stops soon
40936,annoyed,I agree and annoying because he wont be quiet and keeps making fun of me 
40943,angry,Was your name on it
40944,angry,Have you had issues with this worker before
40945,angry,Yes I think they did it on purpose It makes me so mad thinking about it 
40964,disgusted,Oh no Im sorry to hear that 
40965,disgusted,I would have done the same thing Some people have no respect
40966,disgusted,Its okay I called the cleaning company because I was so disgusted by the smell
41004,disgusted,Oh that sounds awful What did you do
41005,disgusted,At least once its over its over I would consider other airlines next time I would also write a complaint letter 
41006,disgusted,I just have to suck it up even though I was disgusted and had to hold my nose the entire time
41013,angry,I have Its definitely awful Its much like losing a family member
41014,angry,Oh no What a horrible thing to happen Im sorry to hear that
41015,angry,Yes I had a party and one of my friends let him out and he was ran over
41119,disgusted,That sounds like a smelly situation
41120,disgusted,I hope you get that cleaned up
41121,disgusted,I walked into the garage this morning its a horror show
41122,disgusted,Trash comes tomorrow morning
41156,annoyed,Oh my why cant they just set a time and commit to it
41157,annoyed,I agree you should talk to your friend to be more committed to the plans
41158,annoyed,Tell me about it  Some people just drive me crazy
41159,annoyed,I think I might have too  Im getting tired of them always changing things last minute
41191,annoyed,Glad to hear youre feeling better again  How did you hurt it
41192,annoyed,That sucks  Maybe you need to be a bit more careful until its fully healed
41193,annoyed,Just exercising but I tweaked it again last night and now its hurting again
41197,annoyed,I am sorry you have had back luck There are some honest people out there 
41198,annoyed,I know it is true You just have to try to focus on the good I suppose 
41199,annoyed,That is true but some people are just insincere
41211,angry,I know its a blow but youre only human Everybody makes mistakes sometimes
41212,angry,Im sorry People can be greedy and unempathetic
41213,angry,My boss didnt understand that The mistake that made cost him a lot of money
41247,annoyed,Thats not good  Cant you withhold if they refuse to fix the leak  I would be really mad 
41248,annoyed,That is true about the waste  I would sue for compensation  I think the law is on your side regarding this issue
41249,annoyed,Yeah my next step might be to call the tenant board Its costing me a lot to lose so much water not to mention its wasteful 
41250,annoyed,Thats in interesting point Ill look into that For now Im just so annoyed 
41264,disgusted,Oh thats not fun I hope it cleared when you took it out 
41265,disgusted,It should have cleared it I once left bread for two weeks when I went home for winter vacation
41266,disgusted,When I finally realized what it was I took out the trash then lit every candle I have and opened the windows 
41273,disgusted,Thats not right You could probably complain anonymously to the city 
41274,disgusted,No Theres definitely something wrong if they wont call a pest control company
41275,disgusted,I will try that but I am thinking about moving I cant live in such disgusting place anymore
41291,angry,That is terrible How much did it cost you to fix it
41292,angry,I understand Does the grocery store have outside some camera
41293,angry,I havent found out yet  It makes me want to track the person down and give them a piece of my mind
41309,angry,That sounds awful Did they fix the order
41310,angry,I dont think I would ever order from that place again
41311,angry,I dont think it ever came out right They really messed up 
41338,angry,Thats frustrating  We have cat scratching posts EVERYWHERE to try to avoid that but still had to put the sticky tape on the couch to prevent scratching
41339,angry,Cats are always getting into things they shouldnt but I still love them
41340,angry,I have a cat scratch past as well but he really liked the smell of the leather  I should have known he was going to do that
41350,angry,That is the worst  Did you have somewhere you needed to be
41351,angry,That stinks  Hopefully you are not to mad because of it  Flat tires happen to the best of us
41352,angry,Nothing too important I was gonna go get breakfast  I guess Im not doing that now 
41353,angry,Indeed they do  Just really bad timing is all
41527,disgusted,There will surely be maggots on that when you get home
41528,disgusted,Ill never go to your house in that shape
41529,disgusted,Thats exactly what happened and I swore to never make the mistake again as long as i can help it
41530,disgusted,I agree  Especially the green ones
41531,disgusted,My husband always says alcohol makes them acceptable  lol
41532,disgusted,All of them need to disappear from this earth
41533,disgusted,I would have cried for hours
41534,disgusted,I hate spiders and frogs and snakes
41535,disgusted,Yep  That moment sparked a lifelong hatred of spiders lol
41564,angry,That happens more often that you might think Just because its expensive doesnt mean its any good
41565,angry,Yep probably would have been happier at some hometown diner
41566,angry,Thats very true I hate being disappointed like that but thats the gamble I guess
41567,annoyed,Oh yeah I hate that too Its so inconvenient to be closed when people have time to go there
41568,annoyed,I agree Its about time society caught up
41569,annoyed,Yes were now living in a 247 day world and we need our systems to keep up with that
41583,annoyed,Wow  can you ask them to tone it down at all  That would drive me crazy
41584,annoyed,That is just crazy they should not disrupt the complex like that
41585,annoyed,they dont speak english and i dont speak spanish  I complained to my apartment complex managment but they dont care
41625,angry,why is that exactly
41626,angry,I try to forget about how bad it really all is
41627,angry,I keep up with my finances on a daily basis and weekends and holidays always make that more difficult
41679,angry,DId you get out and kick them
41680,angry,I have bad road rage

41705,angry,i hate when that happens I stub my toes all the time im surprised i didnt break none of them yet
41706,angry,good thing is they heal pretty fast and you dont need a cast or anything like that

41767,disgusted,Oh that sounds disgusting Have you talked to him about it
41768,disgusted,Oh no I would be trying to find another place if I were you or tell him to find one
41769,disgusted,Yeah but he just burpes and ignores me 
41802,angry,That is why you never have kids
41803,angry,I also keep my room dirty
41804,angry,Well I dont understand why they cant keep their room clean I tell them so many times
41805,annoyed,I know the feeling What you have to do is call in sick on a day that youre schedule to go in
41806,annoyed,Let me know if it works for you
41807,annoyed,Haha thats a good  idea might have to do that one day
41829,annoyed,Oh I know they are so annoying You should try the Do Not Call list
41830,annoyed,Well if they violate it they will have to pay you some money May be good to contact a lawyer
41831,annoyed,I do but they still call me Frustrating
41881,annoyed,Oh I bet you wanted to over there and yell at them Some people are so inconsiderate
41882,annoyed,If it is too bad you should file a noise complaint with the police Sometimes that is the only way to get the message across
41883,annoyed,And this is not the first time either  You are right so people are very selfish and it is frusterating  
41893,annoyed,I live in the city too I cant stand traffic either
41894,annoyed,Oh that sounds even worse than my city Im sorry
41895,annoyed,It takes me 30 minutes to go a couple of miles Sooo frustrating 
41920,disgusted,Disgusting I hate rodents
41921,disgusted,I hope you dont either If you do you may need an exterminator or a cat 
41922,disgusted,Yeah me to and the fact that it was dead was even worse I hope I dont find any more
41942,angry,Did he give you a chance to tell your side of the story
41943,angry,He does not sound like someone who is good to work for  Im sorry to hear about his ignorance toward you
41944,angry,I told him it was my colleague who messed up the final report but he didnt care and I was held responsible anyway Im so mad over it
41945,disgusted,That sounds so fun and relaxing Did you enjoy yourself
41946,disgusted,That sounds so gross I am so sorry I hope you got a refund
41947,disgusted,Well things were going great until I bit into my food and found a long black hair in it
41948,disgusted,5
41970,disgusted,I boarded a flight to my destination while on board I requested a particular drink and it was declined
41971,disgusted,For flimsy reason it must be an attitude problem
41972,disgusted,Why was it declined
42016,annoyed,thats cool dont need a diaper rash
42017,annoyed,thats usually what happens lol 
42018,annoyed,Yeah but within five minutes of putting his diaper back on he unloaded the poo everywhere  
42071,angry,That is annoying  Is someone in your house not doing there job cleaning after themselves
42072,angry,That is no good  What are you going to do about it
42073,angry,No they think they are but I guess they are lazy and dont use soap on their dishes or will just dust the plate off and put it in the drain lol
42125,disgusted,That is so so sad Are they going to separate or is there a chance that he can change his ways and earn her trust again
42126,disgusted,It is very difficult but Ive see marriages recover from that position  but it takes years to build up that trust again properly I wish them all the best
42127,disgusted,I think there is a good chance they will they are talking to each other at the moment so who knows what will happen
42128,disgusted,Oh gross you should bail quick if you see a kid getting sick so that you wont be around to help clean it up
42129,disgusted,Im sorry maybe a nose plug would come in handy
42130,disgusted,i would love to do that but for some reason im always at the wrong place at the wrong time
42131,annoyed,as a matter of fact my friend asked me help him move recently  but i was busy at work too he understood 
42132,annoyed,we cant win them all  but work always comes first 
42133,annoyed,Yeah my friend understood and then changed his whole moving day to a day I had off
42143,disgusted,No way thats gross
42144,disgusted,I hope they at least fixed it for you
42145,disgusted,I was so grossed out Im never going back
42187,annoyed,Please call the policeits called noise abuse
42188,annoyed,Thats what you have to put up with with the wrong neighbors
42189,annoyed,Thats what I plan on doing tonight if it happens again  Its so rude of them
42212,annoyed,Thats the worst when they take forever Have you called them up
42213,annoyed,Yeah I understand they should at least give you a discount
42214,annoyed,Yes they said they had some issues but still I dont want cold food
42264,annoyed,I imagine that must be so awful Have you had that before
42265,annoyed,I hope the doctor can help you get the pain away
42266,annoyed,No just started recently I have a doctors appointment next week
42273,annoyed,Tell me about it they have to be in my top 5 things I hate the most
42274,annoyed,Plus they are so small its harder to kill them for me Flies are larger so I have an easier time getting rid of them
42275,annoyed,Yep they are a real pain in the neck
42286,disgusted,No way Thats sad for the man but gross for you
42287,disgusted,Wow that is disgusting
42288,disgusted,From what I know the man was real nice but his dementia had gotten very far There were silverfish everywhere in the house he had to live in and a stack of discarded adult diapers just piled in a corner
42310,disgusted,No way That must have smelled so bad
42311,disgusted,I can imagine eww
42312,disgusted,Yes awful it made me so nauseous I almost throw up
42351,annoyed,I take the bus so I dont have to deal with the traffic but man that sounds like it would really stink
42352,annoyed,Wow he sounds like jerk
42353,annoyed,It does but I guess Im also kinda used to it  But Im sitting there just minding my own business and this guy decides hes more important than anyone else  And he flies up the emergency lane beside me completely blocking any emergency vehicles that may need to use it
42357,annoyed,oh oh so now you dont know where your enemy is hiding  Sounds scary
42358,annoyed,How annoying but would be wise imagine it jumping on you while you sleep
42359,annoyed,Its scary and annoying because now I have to systematically check every inch of my room because Im definitely not sleeping here with that big ol spider somewhere in my room
42423,annoyed,Omg yes mosquitos are awful Do you use any spray
42424,annoyed,Nothing seems to for sure keep those things away but the bites are the worst
42425,annoyed,I tried some but it didnt help that much I think I need some citronella candles to handle the pesky critters
42471,disgusted,Im sorry to hear that  What happened
42472,disgusted,I know how frustrating it can be when we receive so an awful service  They should train people to do a better job
42473,disgusted,I missed my flight and simply pleaded with her to change to the next available she just snubbed me
42496,angry,I would be so mad I cant believe people can do that and sleep at night
42497,angry,I hope so too That is just not right They could have left a note at least
42498,angry,Yeah I really was ticked off I hope karma catches up with them one day
42525,disgusted,I remember that A lot of people were grossed out and didnt want to do it Were your girls one of them
42526,disgusted,Yea it tends to be kinda gross My teacher had us dissect fish as well and I prefere that much more for some reason
42527,disgusted,No but I was  I couldnt stay and help out I had to leave  It was very gross and it smelled horribly
42599,disgusted,Oh that sounds horrible I hope it wasnt a long ride on the bus 
42600,disgusted,Oh no that is a long time to be sitting in trash basically
42601,disgusted,It was about 4 hours lots of time to enjoy it
42608,annoyed,Not that I can think of Can you give me an example
42609,annoyed,Oh I see what you mean Thats frustrating
42610,annoyed,I can like for instance someone using an automated system when they claim to be selling items as hand made
42611,annoyed,It can be especially when your income depends on it 
42615,disgusted,Oh wow that really sucks Did you ever find the culprit
42616,disgusted,Yeah I wouldve definitely quit once I saw that
42617,disgusted,I didnt But wow was it gross I almost wanted to quit on the spot
42645,angry,Oh no That sounds like a messy situation
42646,angry,Hopefully hell learn that thats not the place to do that
42647,angry,It does indeed I was so mad at him
42676,annoyed,That sucks was it a nice rug

42694,angry,Oh it was 2 miles high I was so angry as I shoveled it into the furnace
42728,disgusted,eww i know how that feels
42729,disgusted,i would be too
42730,disgusted,I know I was so sick when I had to clean it up
42731,disgusted,Oh geez I bet that was a CATastrophe

42764,disgusted,Oh no Thats horrible Were you able to clean it up
42765,disgusted,I could imagine
42766,disgusted,yea but it was sickening
42776,disgusted,I know what you mean  Its an easy chore but sometimes that smell is gross  Its that sweet smell yuck
42777,disgusted,Well now i definitely dont want to take the garbage out tonight  Ill make someone else do it
42778,disgusted,Yeah sweet is a way to describe it Its this sickly strange garbage smell that exists nowhere else in nature and I hate it
42823,angry,Wow that really stinks Did you catch the culprit
42824,angry,Yeah especially since I imagine that is a costly monthly expense I would install some turrets in your garage
42825,angry,No  I am a bit upset that my home security system did not go off  
42826,disgusted,Thats always fun to clean up
42827,disgusted,Think of it this way Yesterday I had to clean up my dogs vomit where it vomited up a used tampon
42828,disgusted,It really isnt Im sick thinking about cleaning it up
42838,angry,Oh no Were you able to clean it up
42839,angry,Yeah hopefully it doesnt happen again
42840,angry,I was But I was so angry about it
42844,annoyed,I do too but seems like most people are like that nowadays
42845,annoyed,I would be mad we had that problem all the time at the last place we lived 
42846,annoyed,my neighbors were having a party and one of their guests blocked my driveway and it took them 20 minutes to move their car when I needed to leave today
42854,disgusted,That sucks hope it didnt dry into the carpet
42855,disgusted,Thats pretty understandable
42856,disgusted,nope but still annoying
42863,annoyed,dangit  i would have been pretty upset  not to mention the clean up 
42864,annoyed,shhhhhheeeeess  that would have given me a small heart of attack or just tunnel vision out of rage
42865,annoyed,Totally I was so annoyed since it was a 10 million dollar carpet
42869,angry,Oh no You must have been so mad
42870,angry,That dog probably wouldnt be living in my house anymore Did you have it cleaned
42871,angry,I was Especially since it was a 10 million dollar carpet

42970,angry,Its hard for me to wake up early I have to cut my cellphone usage down or Ill be up all night looking at youtube 
42971,angry,I just like getting to stay up late and still get enough sleep
42987,annoyed,Oh wow thats kind of rude
42988,annoyed,Have you brought it up to her Maybe she doesnt realize shes doing it
42989,annoyed,Yes it is upsetting because she alludes to her children being smarter and more wellrounded than mine
42990,annoyed,I have not had a conversation with her about it However I know she does it on purpose just to get on my nerves She has a history of getting enjoyment out of messing with me and now my kids
42994,disgusted,Oh no How did you find out
42995,disgusted,Ah I see I hope you find someone more respectful and caring
42996,disgusted,under my roof she taught I will be off to work I forgot something and I caught them in the act
42997,disgusted,I hope so just trying to be strong
43005,angry,did you try redoing your steps of the last day to see maybe you left it at a friends house
43006,angry,i feel bad for you have you tried asking other people that are near you often to see if they have seen it
43007,angry,I did try to retrace my steps but I never found it Its quite expensive so its not easily replaced
43103,annoyed,they must have something against trucks
43104,annoyed,thats true and also not a good sign if a cop decides to pull you over
43105,annoyed,More like they just dont want to roll around with a bunch of empty beer cans in their ride
43106,annoyed,Yeah and it would also make me look pretty bad  Jerks
43132,disgusted,What happened to make him flood things Something overflowed
43133,disgusted,Thats too bad Well I hope it didnt ruin anything special
43134,disgusted,Apparently after having a shower he forgot to close the water flow That seemed to me to be a truly stupid excuse
43146,annoyed,That has to be really annoying  Have you called animal control
43147,annoyed,Yes thats one way to deal with it  What did you end up doing
43148,annoyed,i didnt know i could do that
43180,angry,what did she do woke up late

43205,annoyed,Sounds annoying she needs to be more careful
43206,annoyed,I have a new mom who is quite obsessive with her baby and she keeps accidentally sitting on him and making him squeal so I had to get up a lot and move hime
43207,annoyed,Yesbut even humans dont have it right a lot so not all animals do either If I move him away from her she screams all nightso I guess I wont get much sleep for awhile lol
43230,angry,aweee you got puppies i barely sleep so i feel you
43231,angry,thats so sweet of you that you adopted an abused dog and taking care of her
43232,angry,Just one abused dog and she had one 2 weeks after I got her I was planning on getting her fixed soon so its good we found out ahead of time Yes she is quite neurotic about it So its alot I hear youI dont sleep much anyway sometimes so not always the biggest deal
43291,annoyed,Oh man what do you think happened to it
43292,annoyed,Ive had that happen Are you going back to get it

43484,angry,Ah there you go The world isnt completely heartless Yeah I think the trick is to always keep that stuff with your car keys because then youll never forget it
43485,angry,Yeah I had someone give me a little thing of ramen noodles from his desk  Ill manage until I get home
43486,angry,Yeah I used to keep a bunch of stuff ilke that in my desk drawer but Ive gotten lazy and havent been back to the store in a while

43811,angry,Nothing I just had to pay all my bills and I dont get paid until tomorrow so I was just out of luck
43812,angry,I did I knew who it was because theyve been whining about wanting to clean out the fridge but they didnt check what was old and what was new  So irritating
43813,disgusted,Hahahahaha  Im sorry for laughing but that struck me as funny  Is he trying his best or is he trying to get the point across that he shouldnt be cooking
43814,disgusted,That might be a good Christmas present  You could do it as a couple  I did one of those with my wife last year and it was a blast
43815,disgusted,No hes seriously trying I eat it because I love him but I should really send him to a cooking class haha
43893,disgusted,Oh no Im sure it was awful at the time but itll be a good story when he grows up
43894,disgusted,That is too funny Theyll grow out of it soon enough
43895,disgusted,I know  Both of my kids are completely out of it when they wake up in the middle of the night so I went to help him and he peed on me
43919,angry,I hate when they do that They make it so hard to pay for
43920,angry,They sound like a shady hospital to me
43921,angry,I didnt even agree to half the tests that they ran  It gets my blood boiling and yes its so stressful  I usually avoid going at all cost
43998,angry,Oh wow That sounds scary Id be mad
43999,angry,How annoying That sucks
44000,angry,I know I am They do it here a lot you have to be very careful By the way there was NO one behind me for a mile ARG
44029,angry,oh no that is horrible and those things always seem to happen when on your way to work or somewhere important
44030,angry,wow that is a really expensive tire
44031,angry,Right I was late and Im down 200 dollars but at least I still have my job
44054,annoyed,you should probably talk to that co worker and if it doesnt stop i would report it to the HR
44055,annoyed,I dont think you would make any problems who knows maybe he is a pervert
44056,annoyed,I dont know I dont want to make problems for nothing He is a very weird guy
44097,annoyed,Aw man I am guessing you already went to the store Did you have to interact with the manager
44098,annoyed,Yeah that stinks Is it a store you go often

44171,annoyed,Are they like 1000 level classes  If I was in a higher class Id of straight told them to quiet down
44172,annoyed,Yeah youve still got some riff raff around at that level  Man its been a long time but I remember those days
44173,annoyed,You should  I ran out of patience for that stuff real fast
44174,annoyed,They really dont especially since were paying for our educations here
44175,annoyed,They are in 2000 level but still not the most fun thing to deal with you know
44176,annoyed,Definitely I want to try and ask the professor about it
44177,disgusted,Thats sick Did you report them They are supposed to have them cleaned several times per day or they can be shut down
44178,disgusted,I would as that is a serious health hazard

44227,annoyed,That does sound very frustrating
44228,annoyed,The second one yes It works but the stretcher pole thing that is metal doesnt work right Normally I know this company will simply give a partial refund instead of sending me the part that isnt working right so it is frustrating
44343,annoyed,How drunk was he
44344,annoyed,Oh yeah I get it though you do not get paid to babysit
44345,annoyed,He was just slurring words and saying dumb things

44549,disgusted,I have seen the previews Is it good
44550,disgusted,Murder can be interesting I guess
44551,disgusted,Its crazy to hear people talked so casually about murder I cant stop watching though
44552,disgusted,It is interesting if nothing else
44559,annoyed,Can you go back and get it 
44560,annoyed,Might be worth it rather than someone else picking it up
44561,annoyed,Yes but thats like a 20 min drive each way
44562,annoyed,its in my desk Im not worried about it getting stolen
44563,angry,WHAT did you catch them

44583,disgusted,I would have screamed
44584,disgusted,When a cockroach comes in my house the neighborhood knows it
44585,disgusted,Yeah it was really gross I was just in shock
44599,annoyed,Never fun when someone tried to change your schedule Lifes unfair sometimes
44600,annoyed,Well hopefully you were able to get some overtime pay
44601,annoyed,yea it sucks 
44614,angry,What are they getting treatment for
44615,angry,I hope you guys get through it
44616,angry,Just say some prayers and be positive
44617,angry,Therapy in general for lots of problems from their past abuse  In one sense I miss himin the otherI am not sure I could ever be around him again
44618,angry,Me too
44619,angry,I am  Hope for the best prepare for the worst 
44660,angry,Have you checked your lease agreement they may be required by law to follow through
44661,angry,Yeah I would show up at the office and show them exactly where they promised to take care of you That should work
44662,angry,I need to do that tomorrow
44670,annoyed,who did she beat down
44671,annoyed,oh lay the smack down     
44672,annoyed,She plays pranks on me constantly is the issue
44673,annoyed,yeah thats a bad habit I dont like it either
44674,annoyed,lol he is just like my brother You should ignore him just like I ignore my borther
44675,annoyed,Its lazy No matter how much I tell him he still does it
44676,annoyed,If I ignored him then he really wont stop
44683,annoyed,Really Why is that
44684,annoyed,Wow I kinda hope they get fired Why did you need to talk to the landlord
44685,annoyed,They are not good at their jobs I guess
44702,disgusted,Oh no those are so gross
44703,disgusted,That is never a good thing
44704,disgusted,Yeah and they had pooped all over the boxes too So gross
44708,angry,oh yea
44709,angry,what ended up happening
44710,angry,Oh yeah he tried to fight me after hockey the other day
44717,angry,Maybe you should go somewhere else
44718,angry,Yeah you would think they would be good by now
44719,angry,i would but its right next to my job its my fault honestly but as a customer they should be consistent 
44755,angry,Yeah thats definitely not OK Have you thought about contacting a tenants rights group to advocate on your behalf
44756,angry,In some cases you can even legally withhold rent if they arent doing their duty as a landlord Id definitely check out what you can do
44757,angry,I am thinking about doing something maybe that too
44758,annoyed,That sounds very dangerous
44759,annoyed,That would help a lot
44760,annoyed,Yeah it is I think that red light needs a traffic camera on it
44788,annoyed,Oh I
44789,annoyed,Ill bet you were really glad when that flight was over
44790,annoyed,Yeah they let it linger way longer than I was comfortable with
44852,disgusted,Thats the worst  People need to be more considerate and clean up after their dogs
44853,disgusted,I agree completely  People shouldnt have to watch every single step they take just to avoid stepping in it
44854,disgusted,I know its so simple to just carry around a bag we dont need doggy land mines everywhere
44881,disgusted,Ugh that is disgusting  Im guessing it wasnt your own
44882,disgusted,I bet  It would be bad enough it was just spit but the tobacco amps it up to 11  It would be nice if people had enough respect for others not to do that sort of stuff
44883,disgusted,That should solve the problem
44884,disgusted,No It was one of my nasty neighbors with their nasty Skoal habit I almost threw up
44885,disgusted,I know right Im gonna put a very angry passive aggressive note on their door tonight
44886,disgusted,I hope so If not I might have to let my dog poop on the doorstep so they know how it feels lol
44893,annoyed,Has it been rainy there
44894,annoyed,Its been the same way here just rain rain rain
44895,annoyed,It has been all rain it seems
44948,disgusted,oh yea  does it pay well
44949,disgusted,hah you get used to it
44950,disgusted,I dont know I quit half way through my first yard  The smell alone was enough to make me gag
44951,disgusted,I dont ever want to get used to
44955,disgusted,Eww Ive had that happen Did you say something to the person showing you the apartment
44956,disgusted,Wow thats revolting Id report it to the health department

45146,disgusted,lol  she will get better 
45147,disgusted,Well her creative side came out in the meal and we had alfredo sauce on our eggs  it was NOT good
45148,annoyed,I feel you have you tried setting a schedule or is it from lack of rest
45149,annoyed,You may need a vacation or take a little break you dont want to overwork or wear your body down to much
45150,annoyed,Im just working double time while work is busier and everyone has to put in the time I definitely dont sleep as well because of it
45158,annoyed,Thats interesting I have a tv by my couch as well You have good taste
45159,annoyed,Oh I didnt realize your brother had control of it because he slept there Hopefully he finds another spot more comfy
45160,annoyed,Yeah I wish I could watch it but I cannot
45161,angry,Were able to save any of it
45162,angry,It happens to all of us
45163,angry,Yes I saved a small amount and added more I get bothered by my clumsiness
45179,disgusted,Oh no Is she stressed about something
45180,disgusted,Ahh that could be it Sometimes when my cat is stressed she poops or throws up
45181,disgusted,Im not sure Do they do that when they get stressed I just thought maybe I kept her inside too long
45182,disgusted,Its very possible that she was stressed Either way it smelled up the whole house and was totally gross
45199,annoyed,Is it acting crazy or just not working
45200,annoyed,You could name it Bob Marley since its always jammin lol I couldnt resist
45201,annoyed,Record it and have a Office Space moment with it lol
45202,annoyed,That stupid thing is always acting up  
45203,annoyed,HAHA  Thats hilarious  I might do that before I take it out to the field with a baseball bat
45204,annoyed,Haha  Feels good to be a gangsta
45208,angry,I would be too were you in a shopping center
45209,angry,People are so careless
45210,angry,i was at walmart shopping for school supplies
45217,disgusted,What did you say
45218,disgusted,That is nasty but some people just do not care
45219,disgusted,I just got up and moved  He didnt even look around to see if anyone cared
45235,annoyed,That happened to me a couple months ago It was a brand new tire which really sucked
45236,annoyed,Was there construction going on near your house Someone had done work on my roof and I think maybe the nail in my tire came from there
45237,annoyed,Mine was too The nail was from construction
45281,angry,What happened
45282,angry,That sucks did you find them
45283,angry,my dogs got out and they are still missing
45300,disgusted,Dang I guess you should get on that hopefully you drew straws or something but at least you found the source
45301,disgusted,Or get the cat on that all they do is sleep anyway
45302,disgusted,Ha ha yeah  My husband is out of town so Im stuck with it  Might just pick it up with the broom and throw it out with the broom True that  Stank
45303,angry,They didnt leave a note  That is the worst  That is the kind of thing that makes you want to bring out forensics to take a paint sample and hunt the people down to bring them to justice
45304,angry,Ugh that should be illegalwait a minuteI think it is illegal  So frustrating
45305,angry,no they didnt leave anything except for the dent

45332,angry,That was one of them I ordered It just makes me livid
45391,angry,Lol I know you was bad he may need to watch what he eats or at least warn you next time
45392,angry,If yall ate something green like vegetables that could be the reason keep the spray close next time 
45393,angry,Haha yeah its definitely something he ate Its usually not that bad
45412,angry,That sounds pretty serious What did she do
45413,angry,Did your motherinlaw report her to the police
45414,angry,She went into my mother in laws room and stole her pain medication and then went driving 
45415,angry,Of course not my mother in law still thinks she has to save her  Shes been trying for 45 years and Im over it
45416,disgusted,Thats absolutely disgusting What did you do
45417,disgusted,That sounds terrible I really hope your future excursions are dung free
45418,disgusted,I didnt want to only have one stinky shoe so I stepped in with the other foot Then I jumped a few times The smell was so nauseating
45482,annoyed,I hate it when that happens  I bet you were frustrated that all that work waas gone
45483,annoyed,Thats a lot to lose youd think that with technology what it is there would be some sort of autosave function on everything you do
45484,annoyed,Yes it was about 35 hours lost  I didnt know whether to scream or cry ha ha  Technology can be so good and so mean too
45577,disgusted,I agree  That happened to me and I had to stop watching them  I worry too much about it happening to me or even worse my kids
45578,disgusted,I know Hearing statistics doesnt help either  Crazy people doing things every 3 seconds
45579,disgusted,It terrible what some people do to others
45580,disgusted,Thats so true And to think we were all just innocent kids
45606,disgusted,Oh nowhat did you do 
45607,disgusted,Yes I LOVE EGGPLANT How could  you find that really gross 
45608,disgusted,Hahaha well to each their own because I love how eggplant is mushy 
45609,disgusted,Yeah and I dont think you can ever go wrong with deep fried food Anything deep fried is delicious D 
45610,disgusted,EGGPLANT  Have you ever had it
45611,disgusted,Ewww  It was likedeep fried and stuff  It was all mushy and gross  
45612,disgusted,Im glad someone likes it  D
45642,angry,Why is he not asleep 
45643,angry,He will learn with age
45644,angry,He is a crazy toddler and doesnt care that everyones else has school
45645,angry,He doesnt act like it lol
45680,annoyed,Im sorry you dont feel well is it a cold or something more serious
45681,annoyed,I hope you feel better before this big meeting  or maybe you can reschedule it or something
45682,annoyed,It is a stomach flu
45698,angry,Did you get a chance to talk to them yet and introduce yourself
45699,angry,Have you considered getting back at them by pranking them
45700,angry,Its been a week and every day I am picking up their trash of the stairs
45701,angry,lol how
45754,disgusted,That was very generous of you
45755,disgusted,I hope so too Theres nothing worse than someone you trust not repaying you
45756,disgusted,i am just hopeful he will pay me back
45757,annoyed,What is it
45758,annoyed,oh yeah that really do grind
45759,annoyed,A printer that causes more trouble than its worth 
45760,annoyed,The one I use at work NEVER works  I really hate that thing
45764,annoyed,Oh no Were you upset about it 
45765,annoyed,I am sorry that happened I would be upset too 
45766,annoyed,I was a little bit  She told me she loved it last time I took it somewhere  I just dont know what her deal is but I might have to avoid her for a while
45779,disgusted,Ewwwwwwwww Was it a runny poop or a solid poop
45780,disgusted,Yeah I would have totally done the same Thats why I dont want a dog lol
45781,disgusted,Thankfully it was solid I would have died if it was runny and all over the place
45796,angry,Did they hit you
45797,angry,I know what you mean I would have been pissed Probably would have gotten out and throat punched them if they had hit me
45798,angry,No but it was close Talk about road rage
45860,annoyed,Ah thats so terrible Did you find him
45861,annoyed,i think it becomes a practice for him
45862,annoyed,Nope Not yet He does this like every week and comes back the day after Its really starting to get old
45875,angry,Sorry to hear that Have you tried to explain your side of things to your boss
45876,angry,Hopefully this type of situation doesnt happen again That really is disappointing how the system doesnt protect the employees about that type of situation
45877,angry,I tried but he is a real turd  He doesnt listen to anything his employees say  The problem is that it is out of his hands because the customer complained to corporate  It was a total lie but they dont care
45884,angry,Ugh thats always the worst I hope it wasnt something urgent you were waiting on
45885,angry,Yeah Ive had them do that to me before too Its a pain in the keester
45886,angry,No but its just a hassle to take time and go pick it up I wish the delivery guy would have knocked
45896,disgusted,Im sorry thats quite disgusting
45897,disgusted,That is a major issue
45898,disgusted,Yes Im never going back to that restaurant again
45902,disgusted,I dont know if that is a good thing or a bad thing but either way it is EPIC
45903,disgusted,It is hard to recover from a binge like that but do a few thousand situps and youll be good as new
45904,disgusted,Oh at the time I thought I was equivalent to Zeus himself Then the morning came and I felt like yung powerless baby Hercules It was dreadful
45968,disgusted,If you keep doing them youll look better
45969,disgusted,Maybe you should go on a diet so you dont feel sick D
45970,disgusted,Yeah but meanwhile I want to throw up every time I see myself
45998,annoyed,I know Its terrible everywhere And Im the only one who knows how to drive because I created the automobile
45999,annoyed,Ugh The horn is the worse Especially those loud obnoxious semitruck horns
46000,annoyed,indeed thats how it is now and horn sounds are just terrible It gets on my nerves
46001,annoyed,Are you baking What did you burn
46002,annoyed,That is pretty unfortunate You should be like me and just buy them always easier when someone else does the work
46003,annoyed,YES  LOL  My brownies  All that time mixing and preparing wasted 
46004,annoyed,I like the taste of home baked goods though  Fresh from the oven  YUM  Now theyre just black
46005,disgusted,Thats really gross Did you say anything to him about it
46006,disgusted,For sure That really isnt something a normal person should be doing Or anyone for that matter
46007,disgusted,No I think the person had mental issues  It was beyond gross
46015,disgusted,lol hey at least it was your neighbors sidewalk and not yours
46016,disgusted,Maybe you should find out who did it and go throw toilet paper all over their yard
46017,disgusted,I know  I didnt even know that was something people really did I thought it was just in the moviesGross
46027,annoyed,That is funny Dogs can be careless You should take better care of it
46028,annoyed,You seem to be very fed up with him How long have you had him
46029,annoyed,Well it wont be an issue anymore I put it up for adoption This was the last straw
46037,angry,Im sorry that keeps happening to you
46038,angry,I agree your talents would be better suited elsewhere 
46039,angry,It is really irritating  It makes me think I need to go find a new company
46040,angry,Thank you
46041,annoyed,That is pretty unlucky At lease it wasnt a power outage though
46042,annoyed,Its like 100 degrees during the day you would have had to find a pool to jump in
46043,annoyed,Yeah true that wouldve been worst
46071,disgusted,That is indeed pretty gross Perhaps you should help her clean it up
46072,disgusted,I dont blame you but we have to help our struggling siblings out
46073,disgusted,Im thinking about just paying a maid I dont think I can handle all that mess
46090,annoyed,Ruh Roh Did it come out of the rug easily
46091,annoyed,Yeah thats never a good experience  Coming home to that smell and mess ugh
46092,annoyed,It did fortunately But I am starting to get so fed up with his antics
46096,annoyed,You should get some bug spray Flys are nasty
46097,annoyed,I once chased a fly around my room for 30 mins never caught it I think it was all in my head
46098,annoyed,Yeah right And it seems like they dont have an off button they just fly around nonstop
46105,disgusted,Used to be What happened to it Did it get closed down
46106,disgusted,That sounds alarming You better be careful next time visiting the place They maybe careless with their sanitary responsibilities
46107,disgusted,They are not completely shut down yet but they have recently failed several health inspections
46108,angry,That would get very irritating Have you talked to her about it and let her know how you feel
46109,angry,Thats too bad I am sure it makes things very stressful and difficult
46110,angry,I did many times She doesnt seem to understand or even consider my concerns I think we will not go any further with such attitudes
46120,annoyed,Does it bother you when she does that
46121,annoyed,It can really be annoying when someone tells you what to do  Have you talked to her about it
46122,annoyed,Yes I dont know why  It is getting so irritating
46194,disgusted,Wow thats quite a feat Did he get sick
46195,disgusted,Yeah Id be tempted to barf myself witnessing that
46196,disgusted,Im not sure  It was beyond gross
46208,disgusted,Uh oh what did you do
46209,disgusted,Ew that does sound gross  Was it some sort of bet or thats all you had
46210,disgusted,I ate some nasty mushy eggplant for dinner 
46211,disgusted,No It was something I was trying at a restaurant for dinner  They were friend and almost made me gag
46219,disgusted,Oh yuck Maybe it was expired then
46220,disgusted,I hope you threw it out
46221,disgusted,I am pretty sure  I was really sickened by it
46231,annoyed,I remember my first city apartment the lights and sirens It can be difficult
46232,annoyed,I dont think they know about mufflers You should try white noise and black out curtains
46233,annoyed,Yeah right It seems like they never stop and not to mention the people who feel the need to make their cars as loud as possible
46234,disgusted,Jeez Was it audible Smellable
46235,disgusted,Whew I would be too God knows if she messed herself
46236,disgusted,It was loud and stank I was really grossed out
46240,angry,From your house do you have any idea who did it
46241,angry,I would be furious they are expensive now a days
46242,angry,It was at the office  I have no clue who did it  I am so mad about it
46265,disgusted,garbage collection most important
46266,disgusted,all police not bad
46267,disgusted,It was very dangerous and really messed up of the guy to do something like that Too bad police were not around
46280,angry,You uttering this phrase i remembered the Peter Griffin Meme So tell me what grinds your gears
46281,angry,Why you guys dont you deliver a complain note to the management They are responsible for handling the office tools
46282,angry,This STUPID printer that I have at work  That thing NEVER does what I tell it to and it ALWAYS runs out of ink
46283,angry,They are just as bad as this stupid printer
46307,angry,That would make me angry and it is impossible to deal with in a drive thru
46308,angry,I agree I really hate driving off only to find out a third of your order is wrong or missing
46309,angry,I was very upset and I wanted to speak with the manager about it Customer service is so bad these days
46313,angry,I would be pretty furious as well those can be expensive to get removed
46314,angry,I agree some people just dont care about anyone but themselves Its sad
46315,angry,People just dont seem to have any respect for other peoples property anymore
46338,angry,Oh no What had happened
46339,angry,On the bright side you can buy a new vase to replace it
46340,angry,I was dusting and I knocked it over  I am so upset with myself
46353,annoyed,Thats so frustrating Do you know who it is
46354,annoyed,Sorry to hear that Maybe you and the other tenets can lobby for additional parking somehow
46355,annoyed,It seems to be random people each time I think they just made the spacing way too close
46381,angry,Yikes That made a mess I bet Did you get burned
46382,angry,Yeah and it can stain I drop my coffee more often than I am willing to admit
46383,angry,No just a hassle to clean it all up
46418,annoyed,jeez that sucks
46419,annoyed,what time is the trip
46420,annoyed,yeah I spend half my life waiting for my family 
46421,annoyed,We could leave anytime Im an early riser Do you get up early
46435,angry,Oh no that sounds frustrating I get road rage
46436,angry,Yes Whats even worse is when other people dont pay attention in bad traffic
46437,angry,It just makes me so mad
46447,disgusted,That sounds like it would be pretty gross
46448,disgusted,Definitely Im not a super clean person but thats a bit far
46449,disgusted,It was really gross behavior
46483,angry,What place did you go to
46484,angry,That makes sense but yeah human error is a very real thing which is why self driving cars would probably be an improvement
46485,angry,Oh it doesnt really matter but it was just McDonalds Funny enough they have those new selforder kiosk things and when I do it on there it almost always comes out right since Im doing it myself Unfortunately you can only do that inside 
46486,angry,Hah thats a very interesting point
46516,disgusted,Oh thats disgusting Have you tried to talk to them about it
46517,disgusted,Oh my god I would contact your city or DHEC I bet if they started to get fined they would clean it up
46518,disgusted,I did and they are crazy or something they told me that I deserve to smell and see it
46519,disgusted,Thank you I didnt realize I could to that
46549,angry,Im sorry  I hope you find it
46550,angry,You also need to cancel any credit cards
46551,angry,If not I am in big trouble due to it having all my Ids
46552,annoyed,I have no idea As someone with loans myself it makes me so angry thinking about how much money Ive been robbed I wasnt thinking at 18 years old I didnt understand the amount
46553,annoyed,No I understand Its really stressful and someone needs to do something about it
46554,annoyed,Well its not necessarily that it was dumb to take out loans its just the amount you have to take out how expensive college is how much interest is paid on them how you can escape them from bankruptcy and how you have almost no time at all before you have to start paying them back before youve even gotten on your feet after graduating Sorry just stressful
46587,disgusted,I would be mad as heck Did you confront them about this behavior
46588,disgusted,Well I might leave him a surprise in the fridge for the next time he comes over Some ExLax chocolate pudding or something
46589,disgusted,Im not really a confrontational person I asked my roommate to say something since he knows him better obviously He said he brought it up but didnt seem to change much Then I kind of said something too but the guy just kind of laughed it off like he thinks were just joking I dunno what goes through his head
46590,disgusted,Haha maybe Ill take that into consideration
46603,annoyed,lol I dont blame you Did you end up letting her
46604,annoyed,My mother used to do that when I was young I hated it hurt so bad with her long nails
46605,annoyed,She was sitting behind me and helped herself to it
46628,angry,Thats terrible Are you working more hours or are they cramming it into the hours you already have
46629,angry,I hate when management does that I would ask you if they are compensating you for overtime but if theyre already treating you like this then I doubt it
46630,angry,More hours and also more work crammed in so bad on both sides
46714,disgusted,Why is it sad
46715,disgusted,They do but sadly that is part of life
46716,disgusted,PEople do horrible things sometimes Its just terrible
46717,disgusted,IT is interesting to watch but still a bit disheartening
46721,disgusted,Eww I hope he was outside  that stuff stinks
46722,disgusted,I bet it was Dont you just hate those eating contests where people are shoving stuff into their mouths so fast
46723,disgusted,No I have to admit canned tuna is not one of my favorites Did you watch this on TV
46724,disgusted,Yes it was very gross to witness
46725,disgusted,It can be interesting sometimes but not on this occasion
46744,angry,Have they gotten in fights like that before and did the police get called
46745,angry,Yuck I used to live in a rough area and that kind of thing would happen It gets really old fast
46746,angry,Not quite as loud but they have before They break up about once a month I think the police did come
46750,disgusted,Aaah gross I bet it smelled awful
46751,disgusted,Garbage smell is the worst Its like this specific sweet sick smell found nowhere else in nature
46752,disgusted,It did I felt so gross and couldnt get the smell off of me even after several showers
46763,annoyed,Oh no That is such an inconvenience  
46764,annoyed,Is it something you can do yourself or does it have to be done at a shop
46765,annoyed,It is It doesnt seem cheap to fix either
46801,disgusted,So gross Ive been there Hopefully not new shoes
46802,disgusted,Oh geez Was it in your own yard
46803,disgusted,Fortunately not but I was wearing sandals so I guess its even worse really
46814,angry,Sometimes governments can be detrimental rather than helpful What is the harassment
46815,angry,Thats too bad We get a lot of gunshots here too and no one comes to help
46816,angry,Everything from my grass an inch too tall by the way I have abandoned houses all around me with all kinds of debris and grass 7ft tall toMy car parked on MY lawnThey dont show up to gunshots all night fire bombs breaking in too abandoned houses rapes beatingsbut they care if my own car is parked on a lawn that I mow

46857,angry,no cameras
46864,angry,call the popo
46865,angry,spray the hose in that direction to get the tv wet
46866,angry,Ive reported him to the association because its against our rules but he doesnt care I dont know how people can be so selfish
46927,angry,Thats too bad Do you mow a lot
46928,angry,Absolutely There are things far more important than lawn length
46929,angry,Once a week makes it hard when I work two jobs like good people do I am not retired just mowing my yard all do Makes it hard when my mower was stolen as wellwhich the police do nothing aboutinstead of ticketing decent people they should try and stop all the rapes and shootings in the area and deal with all the abandoned houses
46930,angry,They just want to make easy money Blight people are supposed to do something about abandoned housing issuesLike furniture and trash all over
47002,annoyed,Did you have some special plans for the weekend that you couldnt go do 
47003,annoyed,Well hopefully you can go soon

47092,disgusted,No I was grossed out by him digging through the trash and eating it
47111,annoyed,That would be annoying
47112,annoyed,That would be bothersome especially if its taking away from your time
47113,annoyed,Yea occasionally it is funny but most of the time it is bothersome

47217,annoyed,Did they apologize to you
47218,annoyed,No not an Uber driver Thatd be a little more understandable It was just a friend who was running an errand and got stuck Last time I do that for them any time soon
47219,annoyed,It was kind of a halfway apology something they did in a rush Then they just carried on like normal Oh well
47238,disgusted,Yikes I live in the south and we dont get those Just palmetto bugs flying roaches I think Id rather have those than rats personally
47239,disgusted,My girlfriend has complained about rats too since she lives in the midwest Says shell be taking out the trash and shell hear them scurrying and it will freak her out Good luck to you guys who have to deal with the little diseaseinfested things
47240,disgusted,Yes I hate rats and it was already smelling really bad

47351,annoyed,Did you wind up eating it
47352,annoyed,lol you are such a nice person I would have definately kicked that guy out
47353,annoyed,Yeah it was a bit crunchy but I wasnt going to let it live rentfree in my mouth At least I got my protein for the day
47380,angry,Did you flip the bird Some people are so rude

47590,disgusted,I agree most dont bother with something so simple like throwing away trash or returning grocery carts or holding open doors
47591,disgusted,Some people just have no common courtsey
47635,annoyed,That sucks  Did they give a reason
47636,annoyed,Well maybe you can complain and get some money back or something

48003,annoyed,If that happens again you should tell them they should have to pay you the appropriate wage to do work that theyre supposed to be doing themselves Thats insane
48004,annoyed,Yeah thats what I thought  It was quite irritating
48036,angry,That was rude Did they stop
48037,angry,Thats still tough to go through though
48038,angry,i started to get mad but then as i got closer i saw that it was a kid so i just had to eat it
48110,angry,What happened Are you ok

49450,annoyed,Did anyone see it happen
49451,annoyed,yea i was so mad at myself
49459,angry,wow are you ok that can be really unnerving 
49460,angry,i would be to people need to be more aware on the road
49461,angry,yea i was so mad
49478,annoyed,Kids are sweet They will do everything to get what they want So did her mom made him Kraft Dinner eventually
49479,annoyed,Dont be upset about it Kids do not yet have conscious ability to think concretely in terms of others feelings
49480,annoyed,She she did unfortunately I made a delicious chicken dinner and he wouldnt even eat it
49490,annoyed,Oh no I would have asked for the manager What did you do
49491,annoyed,I cant imagine why that person would do that So unreasonable
49492,annoyed,Thats what I did actually The manager was apologizing to me It was just frustrating
49499,disgusted,Ugh I hate when that happens Do you think the cat ate something bad
49500,disgusted,I bet Poor kitty I hope heshe feels better soon
49501,disgusted,not sure but it was really horrible

49530,angry,that is tough my mothere also has her little dog but more than likely she will move in with my family
49531,angry,Biggest issue is finding somewhere to live that allows dogs
49625,angry,what how what happend if you dont mind me asking

49677,disgusted,I love Trump I could listen to him speak all day
49726,angry,I think kids should all be home schooled
49727,angry,They can hire teachers to come to the house
49728,angry,Im not sure about all but I do see a rise in those being home schooled to ensure the safety of the children  However not all parents are equipped with the ability to home school 
49729,angry,Thats interesting  I wonder if the teachers salary would be impacted by implementing your idea  Its already a challenge to pay teachers what they deserved  I think that good home training is necessary so that the child will know how to act when they are at school
49736,disgusted,Thats non fun Im sorry to heard that Maybe you shouldnt go there anymore
49737,disgusted,The food is not very healthy so you are not missing much
49738,disgusted,Yes that is a great idea
49745,angry,Sorry to hear that Its tough when unexpected things like that happen
49746,angry,Man the tax system needs a complete overhaul Hope things work out for you in the future

49770,annoyed,Never I turn my phone off when I go to the movies
49800,disgusted,Did you threw it back into his car
49801,disgusted,Unfortunately there are people like that in this world but maybe they can change someday
49802,disgusted,Nah I was hoping a police officer could deal with how gross and wrong it is to do something like that
49841,annoyed,If your son is very young and you give him an allowance then tie it to that
49842,annoyed,Haha sadly it does not I still hold off on doing it in my own apartment at 26 Unless they are very young I dont think here really is a good way unless it smells
49843,annoyed,Well hes 20 almost 21 now and I thought that as he grew older it would become automatic  I dont want his potential wife to be frustrated by what should be automatic  
49844,disgusted,how what made you feel do tell
49845,disgusted,wow that sounds horrible i cant believe she even tried to get your number did you give it to her hahah
49846,disgusted,I was siiting beside a girl on the transit bus and she expelled gas and it stunk so bad that the person on the other side of her vomited 5 minutes later she had the nerve to try and flirt with me and tried to get my phone number
49847,disgusted,no i was to busy trying to block any future memory of what just happened out of my memory 
49895,annoyed,I just cannot understand why people wont do their job properly I had to cut my lunch break in order to do more work
49896,annoyed,That is so sad they dont seem to understand workers
49897,annoyed,I am having the same issue Then my manager is asking me to respect deadlines
50042,angry,Yes you were just mentioning it What happened
50043,angry,Did you have your wallet returned to you If its your relative I think that everything should work out for good
50044,angry,Well it happened at a realtives house I thought I could trust but I found out different and it made want  to pull my hair out
50045,angry,No they didnt return it and covered up that they took it And we dont speak any more
50056,annoyed,Thats annoying Have you talked to your boss about it
50057,annoyed,That can be tough Hopefully shell understand
50058,annoyed,We have the same manager I dont want to make trouble I need to find a way to tell her nicely
50085,disgusted,Gross What did you do
50086,disgusted,i think you could have removed them and still ate it isnt that normal for them to have bugs in them sometimes
50087,disgusted,Threw it out right away I was sad because I love good corn
50091,angry,Im sorry to hear that hopefully she naturally mellows out
50092,angry,Wow that doesnt sound good Situations like this are hard because you probably dont want to offend your family and stuff
50093,angry,No I dont think so  Shes 45 and cannot raise her kids  She lives with my mother in law and my MIL houses them feeds them clothes them basically raises them while my sister in law takes no responsibility
50101,annoyed,I am so sorry that you have to go through that on your day off Just try to be nice to her
50102,annoyed,Maybe you need to go to the store and bring her flowers and chocolate
50103,annoyed,I am I even tried asking her why she is so cranky she says she is fine but it doesnt look like it she just keeps snapping on me over nothing
50128,angry,Ah thats so bad why not raise a complaint
50129,angry,Hope it get resolved soon
50130,angry,Well I had to talk to a supervisor It was clearly an issue on their end and they could see it
50137,angry,I call them hypocrites They take advantage of people whenever it suites their needs Cant stand the presence of such people
50138,angry,I knew a couple of people whom I suspected of fitting the description we talked here And I tried to stay away from them as much as i could
50139,angry,Yup exactly  Especially when youre keeping it real  The least you could do is return the favor
50155,angry,Did this happen recently
50156,angry,That is good that the person was courteous That may not happen everytime
50157,angry,Yes but I told them to let me finish and they did haha
50177,disgusted,Thats disgusting What kind of parent lets their child run around like that
50178,disgusted,Yeah really makes you want to touch anything in a store with booger hands wandering around putting his hands on everything
50179,disgusted,I dont know I had a really hard time finishing my grocery list after I saw that
50187,annoyed,Do you think she will keep you awake How old is she
50188,annoyed,Maybe you can hide some of your things or put them in a safe place 
50189,annoyed,She is 11 and always goes through my stuff and uses my makeup It gets on my nerves
50348,disgusted,Thats disappointing I know how that goes Its happened to be before
50349,disgusted,Sorry 
50350,disgusted,It was it completely ruined my breakfast
50367,annoyed,That seems a little odd It sounds like you guys dont have the best communication Did she say why she didnt ask you
50368,annoyed,I see Im not sure thats healthy but its also not my business I hope that for both your guys sake you are able to communicate a little more properly in the future I dont think therapy on its own can work unless everyone is willing to listen to each other
50369,annoyed,Nope she didnt say why
50394,annoyed,Oh no why is that
50395,annoyed,I can see how that can be annoying Have you talked to him about his drinking
50396,annoyed,All he does is get intoxicated and complain
50397,annoyed,Yes Ive joked about it a few times but he just admits it and things carry on as usual
50434,annoyed,It the trash can damaged
50435,annoyed,That is so messed up
50436,annoyed,No by my trash got dumped all over the place
50437,annoyed,Tell me about it  Some people just have no respect for anyonething
50444,annoyed,Thats the worst is it a big dog or little dog 
50445,annoyed,exactly wow maybe you need to get some sort of bark device  that stops them from barking 
50446,annoyed,Its a tiny dog which is even worse because its bark pierces the ear So annoying
50456,disgusted,Ohhh disgusting  Did you say something to the flight attendants
50457,disgusted,I cant blame you I know I sure wouldnt
50458,disgusted,Yes I also complained to the airline Safe to say I am never flying American Airlines again
50459,angry,I am just like you I have road rage I dont know what it is
50460,angry,Same I usually speed up to another car in another lane and just go the same speed as them It makes it feel so good to see the other person pissed
50461,angry,Like seriously buddy Its one thing if you cant see meand its another to swerve into my lane half a fking inch from my bumper without a turn signalmakes me wanna  bust some heads open hahaha
50475,angry,Oh no what happened
50476,angry,Did you find out who
50477,angry,When I was at lunch someone hit it
50500,angry,I would be very angry to is there anyway to speak with a supervisor to explain what happened
50501,angry,I hope so to get you paid or at least keep a strong relationship so in the future you can work with them again It will work out
50502,angry,Its not a kind of thing where I can go walk into their office or anything but I did message them and show them the part that I did so hopefully that will change their mind At least towards me anyway
50544,annoyed,yeah that makes me mad too
50545,annoyed,that is pretty disgusting
50546,annoyed,Its like brushing your teeth while eating oreos
50547,annoyed,Yes it is but its an accurate description

53541,disgusted,Did she forget it at home or did she just not bother turning it in
53542,disgusted,Be happy that you were able to spend some time with her and sharing personal time with her by helping her with her homework Not many parents do that for their children
53543,disgusted,She just didnt bother She wont even get credit for turning it in late What a waste of time
53544,disgusted,No your right That is so true I just wish she put more effort into school instead of talking in class
53674,angry,Oh my gosh Have they broken it That would drive me nuts
53675,angry,Have you spoken to them personally Maybe they should pay for you to move it
53676,angry,Wow Im so sorry Maybe you could put concrete around it so it damages their car lol
53677,angry,Its been knocked down a few times yes Police have been involved but they dont do anything My neighbor is so carefree about it too its bonkers
53678,angry,Weve chatted about it for sure Like I said the guy doesnt really care Very unnerving

54347,disgusted,i was just talking about how i miss old days and they said that i was too positive
54368,disgusted,me too
54369,disgusted,can you not see it how everyone is just chasing after their desires living in this delusional reality thinking they are free but in reality they are just sheep living in a cettle they dont even see that because of their desires as long sa they can chase after women money and drugs they are fine but they cant see how they are nothing more than just sheep if only there was a way to wake them up to show them what being a human is

54409,disgusted,Yeah she did something The manager was pretty upset too 
54467,disgusted,I know how you feel that would gross me out too  Makes me feel like whoever prepared my food was not very clean
54468,disgusted,I agree I wouldnt be in the mood to eat after that either its disgusting

54973,annoyed,Yes its annoying People should put more thoughts into it before they decide to be so opinionated
54974,annoyed,Oh yes I know Some breeds get bad raps and people are so quick to judge I used to have a pit bull who was a sweetheart
54975,annoyed,Agreed My husband and I did a ton of research on a new puppy we were getting and she still found the worst article she could to act like she knew more than us 
55053,disgusted,Oh my god I bet you were grossed out but laughing at the same time
55054,disgusted,I really hope that is the last time it happens

55458,disgusted,It is I have had that happen with 2 of my cards and my debit card I managed to track down through the charges who used the cards
55459,disgusted,Nope  Its such a pain too Having to contact the credit card company and get a new card issued 
55464,annoyed,Oh wow I would be furious to say the least
55465,annoyed,Well thats good and hopefully the next one doesnt do it too

55486,disgusted,That is really gross How did that happen
55487,disgusted,Oh I see So nothing really bad that could cause a problem really lol
55488,disgusted,I dont think I would help again unless someone found me a face shield
55489,disgusted,ok so i used to work as a wound care specialist and i was helping a coworker There is a thing called a pulse lavage amd it sprays water in the wound
55490,disgusted,lol We ran out of face shields and she accidentally sprayed me in the face 
55491,disgusted,I made sure I had plenty from then on I had to go through a special shower and have my eyes checked It was horrible
55570,disgusted,Omg my current dog does that sometimes She pukes up bile if she doesnt eat so I always have to make sure she is eating her food
55571,disgusted,Oh gross that is disgusting I hope your little buddy is okay though I dont envy you at all
55572,disgusted,well when mine did last week when I went to clean it up it stuck so bad it almost made vomit too
55629,disgusted,Oh I bet probably made you feel sick to your stomach after
55630,disgusted,Thats good easy to quickly notice that awful taste
55631,disgusted,I think so I didnt have that much thankfully or else I wouldve probably spent the day vomiting 
55632,disgusted,Yeah exactly At least milk isnt so sneaky right 
55684,disgusted,What did you eat
55685,disgusted,Oh gross makes me never want McDonalds again

55708,disgusted,All of the food tasted so good but I couldnt get over how recently they killed the courses Stillmoving octopus No thank you
55756,annoyed,I would think that being an only child would be somewhat boring and lonely   HOw bad can it be with your brother
55757,annoyed,Thats not cool  I hope you did well in spite of not having your lucky pencil  Siblings can be quite pesky at times
55758,annoyed,He borrowed my lucky pencil when he knew I had an important test today And he knows I cant function without my lucky pencil during a test  
55853,disgusted,Oh shoot why is that
55854,disgusted,That may be gross but she is just putting effort into her appearnce
55855,disgusted,I go into the bathroom tonight and find my girlfriend plucking out her nose hairs into the sink
55856,disgusted,I might throw up I dont know what to think Ive never seen her do something like that
55936,annoyed,Why Did he do something terrible
55937,annoyed,Wow he is super rude Beat him up
55938,annoyed,hes just so obnoxious I was trying to get w my girlfriend and he kept coming into the room to interrupt us on purpose
55939,annoyed,alright if you insist be right back
56012,angry,Who did he bit
56013,angry,What can you do to help him stop drinking
56014,angry,a family friend Im getting so tired of his drinking
56015,angry,Im going to lock him in a room and let him rot
56056,angry,Oh no Have you ever had one before
56057,angry,Yeah but sometimes these things cant be avoided
56058,angry,No I have not I feel like it is my fault and I should have brushed more
56115,angry,At least you have a wife Probably would if it werent for fights over dumb things
56116,angry,I hope you are right
56117,angry,Well we dont ever really fight over dumb things And we also fight rarely we are over the worst fights lol
56200,disgusted,Woah I never had that happen to me
56201,disgusted,Yes we can truly not judge people because unless you are very close with a person you cant know their full story
56202,disgusted,It came as a total shock She would have been the last person I thought would be a hoarder
56272,annoyed,Do you hate when anybody tells you what to do or just figures of authority 
56273,annoyed,would you feel better if it was in the form of advise instead of point blank telling you to do something 
56274,annoyed,i dont think anyone should have the power or the right to tell you whats good for you if you didnt ask for help
56287,angry,Oh wow was in unprovoked 
56288,angry,Did you try to apologise before she hit you or did you not have time 
56289,angry,I didnt step on her intentionally that was a temper issue
56402,disgusted,Yuck At least the cockroach isnt in your kitchen anymore My cats like to catch mice and bring them to the front door
56403,disgusted,I wouldnt have been able to either Its super gross
56404,disgusted,Thats awful I had to leave the room I couldnt watch
56405,annoyed,Oh I bet that is frustrating  Can you report it to someone
56406,annoyed,I would feel the same way  Perhaps you could mention it to your coworker nicely and they will take pity on you  
56407,annoyed,I have a team leader who I can try to report it to but he always seems to brush me off Its getting old at this point
56457,angry,Thats awesome rain is good
56458,angry,oh no so what do you do in such instance
56459,angry,Rain would be good at first but like I said its oversaturated my crops and mold and mildew has set in
56460,angry,I have to just salvage what I can and move on to the next season
56535,disgusted,I think its so weird that cats do that Its like they are bringing us trophies or something
56536,disgusted,Yeah I would be a little horrified too if my cat did that Im dying of laughter thinking about your situation
56537,disgusted,I know He does it all the time Im glad hes catching mice but I dont need to see the bodies
56585,annoyed,Thats a shame Im sorry Does she have anything to keep her occupied while you work
56586,annoyed,I believe that a lot of people think because youre at home that you have time for things other than work
56587,annoyed,Yes plenty of toys books TV pets homework Its not easy getting any work done in my house
56682,disgusted,Oh Did you find any good deals
56683,disgusted,Uh ohWas it tainted I wouldnt risk it
56684,disgusted,I thought they were good deals until I got home and smelled some of the meat
56685,disgusted,I think it was all expired  It was so gross  I tossed it all
56708,angry,I have not I feel like it should be done by a professional 
56709,angry,Oh no Probably tons of years of dirt caked into the rug Did you use the right cleaner
56710,angry,Maybe the dirt adds to the whole antique feel of them 
56711,angry,I hope you can find a solution that works for you
56712,angry,Well I figured that out I cleaned mine last night They are clean but now they smell horrible
56713,angry,probably not I wish I would have just left them dirty I have them airing out outside now

56986,annoyed,Aw dang that must really be pain for you Have you talked with anyone else about this Im sure other people are having problems with this coworker also 
56987,annoyed,Ohhhhhhh yeah thats really hard on everyone then Taking it to corporate would be a good idea to help the company and the workers if you need to vent out any more frustrations just let me know
56988,annoyed,Oh yeah its been bothering everyone but he is a friend of the manager so he wont fire him At this point me and the other employees are planning on taking it to corporate to get this resolved
57006,disgusted,I do  It grosses me out even when its my own
57007,disgusted,I completely understand  Hopefully the manager was able to take care of it for you
57008,disgusted,I know  I went to this restaurant one time and when my food arrived I started to eat Thats when I noticed a piece of hair in my sandwich I was totally grossed out and lost my appetite
57009,disgusted,Yes They gave me another order to take home
57013,angry,Thats just disgusting
57014,angry,Im glad you were there to show that people still care
57015,angry,Yeah I was shocked someone could be so callous I went and bought the homeless guy a sandwich just to show him not everyones a jerk
57075,angry,Man that really stinks  Did insurance pay to repair your floor and cupboards
57076,angry,When will your house be put back together

57253,angry,He was with a bunch of friends and everyone was doing it Hes grounded
57254,angry,Yes that was my recommendation 
57357,annoyed,Thats terrible  Are you repairing it yourself
57358,annoyed,Can they be fixed or do you have to get different cabinets
57359,annoyed,Luckily it was covered by insurance  However when our new cupboards arrived the fronts and sides were different colors
57461,annoyed,What do you think you can do about it
57462,annoyed,Busted thats good stealing is a horrible thing to deal with
57463,annoyed,Well I reported it and someone caught him in the act

57474,angry,Well it sounds like it was your fault then I would attack you to if you left me at home all day with food lol
57475,angry,I think it was over food he gets upset when he is hungry
57533,annoyed,That is frustrating Most people dont know basic trouble shooting skills 
57534,annoyed,Yeah it can be hard to be patient with people like that 
57535,annoyed,Yes And they also think we have nothing better to do then to just sit and wait for their call grrrr 
57536,angry,I would be mad too you should demand him to buy you more
57537,angry,Yeah make him regret doing such a cruel thing 
57538,angry,Oh trust me I will Might make him clean the house for it as well to make up for it

58454,annoyed,awe man thats the worst
58455,annoyed,thats really sucks
58456,annoyed, I tried reconnectiong and it would work for a while and then disconnect again it was a really good movie too

58472,angry,Lol  I love it  That is a great way to remind her of why she shouldnt lie
58473,angry,I bet she wont do that again
58474,angry,Nope School called me yesterday to inform me she never showed I asked my daughter how her day was at school and she totally played it off like she was there the entire day had no idea i was on to her

60319,angry,He might just be bluffing Unless someone broke into your house
60320,angry,He denied doing it Said he was like that when he got there and he tried to clean up The only other person who had keys to my place was with me

61099,disgusted,Ewww I hope you complained so they can fix the problem That is defenitly a health violation
61100,disgusted,Oh okay Hopefully it isnt a constant problem that would suck to loose your favourite resturant
61101,disgusted,I shouldve I kind of brushed it off because it was one of my favorite restaurants and it looked like a short and thin hair like an eyelash
61102,disgusted,I dont think it is Ive never had that problem before there I just hope it doesnt happen again because I totally lost my appetite 
61122,disgusted,Filled up You better clean it before it overflows
61123,disgusted,Ew yeah definitely sounds like it needs a good cleansing
61124,disgusted,It is super gross Not yet but just the smell is horrid
61128,disgusted,I have had that happen to me many times
61129,disgusted,It is definitely  a lot of work but it is the best type of work I have ever done
61130,disgusted,Yeah it was kind of a wakeup call since Im of the age to have children Like Well this is what I have to look forward to Im not wild about the idea of having to deal with getting little sleep and having to deal with their bodily fluids But I know it will make my wife happy
61152,angry,That sounds like a nightmare Hopefully no one was hurt
61153,angry,Did they take a lot of things
61154,angry,It was I am so thankful we were not home
61254,disgusted,Ugh do you know how it got there
61255,disgusted,Oh my goodness Do you think an intruder got in and used your house as a washroom for his dog
61256,disgusted,No thats the worst part I dont even have a dog
61361,disgusted,Okay so I never understood why people ate it What is it about it that makes them want to do that I just flicked mine And I thought it stopped at a childs age Really interesting
61362,disgusted,Ive heard of oral fixations before but only in the context of like chewing fingernails and smoking cigarettes etc But I guess if I think about it a lot of people chew fingernails and Im sure thats just as bad bacteriawise Maybe the booger eaters are on to something
61363,disgusted,I was so grossed out by it  I think it has to be a oral fixation or something like that
61364,disgusted,Maybe it helps build their immune system
61365,disgusted,That must have been unbearable Did you complain to the staff about the smell
61366,disgusted,Good I would avoid that airline too
61367,disgusted,I did because I was disgusted by it Safe to say I am never flying American Airlines again

61465,annoyed,I understand that that is a great move by you do not get sucked in
61466,annoyed,It seems like it right The things they chirp and fight about seem so pointless Must be because theyre bored I dunno I just stay out of it
61467,angry,Eh give him a dollar and tell him to enter the contest himself
61468,angry,He doesnt sound too reasonable if you ask me
61469,angry,Yeah I dont think that will fly I won a prize and he wants to split the prize He knows the odds are small So since I won he wants to forget about trying to do it himself and just wants what I got
61529,angry,Yuck  I hate when friends do that
61530,angry,Yeah I dont blame you  Time to find some new friends
61531,angry,I have never experienced something like this before I cant help but feel rage
