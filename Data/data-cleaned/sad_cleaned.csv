1801,sad,I know how that can be such a struggle  How long has it been and why did it end
1802,sad,Everyone makes mistakes we live and learn I guess  If there is no hope of her taking you back then you have to find a way to move forward but take the time you need to grieve as it is a loss

2971,lonely,Sorry to hear that What was the dispute about
2972,lonely,I understand It should have been not easy
2973,lonely,Well I was quite young at the time with no one I can relate to It was very difficult to decipher it was more of feud between aunts and uncledad The life of poppop was especially not easy on them
2974,lonely,I suppose it has to more with how rough life poppop had and its impacts on them

3307,lonely,Wow but its your personal life
3308,lonely,they didnt like the guy I was dating at the time
3335,sad,Sorry to hear about your loss Sometimes its better for it to be sudden rather than wait 6 months for the cancer to destroy you
3336,sad,everything passes with time
3337,sad,so decide wisely how it is spent 
3338,sad,I guess so It made me a better person but it did suck at the time
3339,sad,Indeed it does good or bad
3375,lonely,I understand I have been lonely most of my life But it gives it back and it makes up the loneliness part 
3376,lonely,I have a solution for that but I wouldnt advocate you doing it 
3377,lonely,Is there any chance for us to break free from loneliness
3378,lonely,tell me about it

3665,sad,No I have to stay off of it completely I can use crutches but in the heat that will not be worth it
3698,lonely,How far away has she gone

3700,lonely,Its a six hour drive
3701,lonely,No I cant find a better job than what I have right now

3789,lonely,No its not I dont know what Im going to do but I sure am angry at him
3796,sad,As a fat guy who wore all black and played Magic The Gathering everyday in the library I can relate lol
3797,sad,I never got in any fights but I never got pushed around either
3798,sad,That is good to know But like one time on my way to lunch someone pushed me face first into the wall I just went to the bathroom and cried the rest of the day
3841,lonely,That must have been really hard on you
3842,lonely,At least you had the dog to cheer you up
3843,lonely,It really was When I came home from work it was just me and the dog
3868,sad,have they contacted the lender for a loan modification

4001,sad,There were a few left but they had devoured most of them I really liked those flowers
4063,lonely,Did you ask them why 
4064,lonely,I would let things cool down for awhile and maybe they will have a change of heart If not  apologize and see if that helps
4065,lonely,No but I think its because we had a major argument and they all took the other persons side
4080,sad,i know how you feel My best friend lives in a different country
4081,sad,not often at all I saw her in 2011 we skype but its not the same

4083,sad,No it isnt at all My BFF and I text and talk on the phone constantly but there is nothing like spending actual time together My son and her son are best friends too and my little boy has been sad ever since they left
4088,sad,That must be very hard on you Im sorry to hear that It must be very scary to experience
4089,sad,Is there anything that can be done from a medical standpoint 
4090,sad,It is like they are dead already without the funeral
4222,sad,15 Wow That has to be tough
4223,sad,I hope it doesnt get to bad for him
4224,sad,Yeah fortunately hes very small so he doesnt have as many joint problems as the bigger dogs I thnik at least
4235,lonely,Yea between kids cleaning and everything else its hard to stay energetic
4236,lonely,Yea then you hae to do it all yourself
4237,lonely,For real  It is worse for me because no one else is here 
4238,lonely,It is so boring
4305,sad,She probably understood
4306,sad,If she is a really good friend then she did Dont worry about it

4415,sad,Well I hope you find him Hopefully nothing bad happened to him
4416,sad,I did but I havent found him yet He usually gets caught up in things so it wouldnt surprise me if he went quite far and lost his way back
4444,lonely,Well even going by yourself you can always have a good time especially with alcohol involved Did you end up having fun
4445,lonely,Thats when you drink more and talk to everyone around you and make a good time for yourself
4446,lonely,I did not I had no one to talk to

4582,lonely,I bet that was scary Did you like it
4583,lonely,Were you ever scared 
4584,lonely,It felt really strange to be by myself But I got used to it
4598,sad,Was that difficult And is it your extended family or your immediate family
4599,sad,I know that can be really tough Sometimes though it can strengthen communication  hopefully theyve been able to visit

4850,lonely,Oh no That is hard I have the same issue How far away did you move
4851,lonely,Yeah I live in a new state 
4868,sad,I am so sorry You must be heartbroken
4869,sad,How long was he part of your life
4870,sad,Yes he was my best friend
4897,sad,That is horrible so sad

5100,sad,Potentially he seemed a bit deadset but we do not know too much all in all
5101,sad,yea they should have forced him to play a little to see what would happen  maybe he would change his mind
5151,sad,im sorry distance sucks luckily you guys have skype 
5152,sad,I know because sometimes technology doesnt work the way we want it too i hope you get to be together again soon 
5153,sad,Yeah we use it all the time Its annoying to deal with sometimes though And it stinks to only be able to talk and not be able to hang out in person

5525,lonely,I am not so sure
5599,lonely,Why is that

5907,sad,I tried calling them this morning and they said they would check their lost and found I have not heard anything from them yet
5908,sad,Yes it would It was even a relatively new phone so I would be devastated if my phone did not appear
5942,lonely,Oh no really that really sucks to hear Why were you not able to go
5943,lonely,It is sad that you can not go but you are making a good sacrifice to make sure your family will be able to survive Also you could use the alone time to do stuff you are not able to do with them around
5944,lonely,I had to stay home and work
5945,lonely,I am sorry they are sweet animals
5946,lonely,That is adorable

6196,sad,Thanks for your condolences Im doing alright trying to get over it Have you ever been fired before
6292,lonely,Why is that
6293,lonely,Oh wow you must have a lot of responsibility there
6294,lonely,Its a small company and the other folks in my department just work part time 
6295,lonely,I suppose so but sometimes I get really bored and need to walk to one of the other buildings just so I can say hello to someone
6350,lonely,Dont feel bad many people are experiencing the same feelings  Try to focus on meeting new and interesting people
6351,lonely,Have you tried online dating  Many of my friends have experienced success with apps like eharmony
6352,lonely,I have but it never works out All of my friends are married now
6353,lonely,I did a while back I might try again
6389,lonely,Sorry to hear that Im in the same boat At least I have two dogs with me Do you have any friends around

6431,lonely,Im sorry to hear that Do you think you struggle to communicate with people
6432,lonely,Shy Yeah I get that I was too until I started getting out more The ability to socialize is a muscle you have to work at
6433,lonely,I am very sky
6494,sad,Im sorry Are you sure you did that bad
6495,sad,Theyll be other interviews
6496,sad,I am and I prepared so much for it Its all quite upsetting
6497,sad,What shows are you thinking of specifically

6541,lonely,Oh wow I cant imagine losing my dad at 67 I hope you make it through these hard times stay strong
6542,lonely,He was only 67 He struggled with a heart condition most of his life Thanks for the kind words
6603,lonely,You should put yourself out there and meet some new people  Just start exploring the city and you are bound to meet others
6604,lonely,It is  It isnt healthy to be by yourself for too long  Humans are social creatures
6605,lonely,Youre right I will do that eventually That is a good way to change my situation rather than sulking around
6635,lonely,I know that can be hard  How long has it been since youve been out with someone
6636,lonely,Yeah alot of times you just have to be reminded why you broke up  I know there is someone out there for you just stay positive and they will come your way
6637,lonely,2 years I thought I missef my ex but wr talk often and I definitely dont want that headache lol
6638,lonely,Thanks Hopefully he is a decent driver
6652,lonely,Well that escalated quickly Im hoping this is not real
6653,lonely, That is messed up did heshe show any warning signs before their passing Its not your fault by the way
6654,lonely,It is real unfortunately
6658,sad,Sorry for the bad news
6659,sad,I know she will make it
6660,sad,Thanks for the condolences They are telling me it isnt severe so I have somewhat high hopes for her eventual recovery
6673,lonely,That must of been no fun
6674,lonely,Did you have a flashlight
6675,lonely,It was way too quiet  You could hear  everything I hated being out there by myself
6718,sad,Aw man Ive been there before Has anyone tried using it
6719,sad,That really sucks Fortunate to hear that no one misused it though They are typically pretty fast at sending you a new one
6720,sad,No I kept track of the transaction on my mobile app Im pretty sure I lost it
6730,lonely,That sucks did you still have fun
6731,lonely,What did you bowl
6732,lonely,No not really I went anyway because I wanted to have a good time It was rather lonely
6784,lonely,That would be depressing did you plan it yourself or did someone plan it for you
6785,lonely,Maybe if you post to social media a bunch of random strangers will show up
6786,lonely,Well both sort of I expected at least one person ya know Not a single soul to be found
6825,sad,I am sorry to hear that
6826,sad,I hope you had fun with her
6827,sad,Thank you she was pretty old so our family sort of expected it but she left so quick 
6948,sad,Oh my god Have you posted everywhere and checked shelters
6949,sad,Oh no Did she have a microchip
6950,sad,Yes we have I feel so bad We have only had her for a few months She was a rescue dog
6954,sad,Im very sorry to hear that hopefully it will get better with time
6955,sad,Im sure she is in a better place Looking down on you
6956,sad,It will She was an awesome lady
6957,sad,I
7058,sad,Im sorry to hear that I lost mine recently also
7059,sad,That must be hard 
7060,sad,Im sure it will get better with time I used to see her everyday for lunch I miss those times
7064,lonely,I know that feeling that is no fun but at least they are learning
7065,lonely,That is good that is a nice way to make a bit of extra money
7066,lonely,Yep I will be alone at home but if I get them all on good schedules I will find a part time job
7067,lonely,Nothing wrong with extra money
7068,sad,Im sorry to hear that  Did you spend a lot of time with her
7069,sad,Thats terrible  I hope shes at least at peace now
7070,sad,I did we were very close it really hit me hard
7147,lonely,who are we talking about
7148,lonely,Oh I am sorry to hear that
7149,lonely,it was me  went to a game alone  got tix for my friend but he could not make it
7281,lonely,It must be hard being apart Just know he will return a better person most likely
7282,lonely,He will need your support when he gets back Just stay strong and know its for the best
7283,lonely,It is very hard I live alone now so it makes it hard especially at night I keep hoping so As he has so many deep rooted issues
7738,lonely,I think you should get out and explore  Im in a similar situationmoved to South Texas with zero connectionsfamily to jumpstart my businessand Ive met some pretty amazing people
7739,lonely,You definitely will trust me
7740,lonely,Yeah I guess I should just put myself out there  I hope I feel better if I finally make some friends
7748,sad,Why did they do tha
7749,sad,I am sorry that happened to you
7750,sad,I do not know i was always smarter than the rest so i think they did not like me
7751,sad,I have grown and learned very much from it
7788,lonely,How did you feel about that
7789,lonely,I know the feeling  Just broke up with my exgf 5 months ago  But heshe is out there chin up 
7790,lonely,Well I felt a bit lonely to say the least
7809,lonely,Aw sorry about that Did you have a pet you could take there with you
7810,lonely,Yeah I have a dog and I take it to the park sometimes It can help you feel less lonely for sure
7811,lonely,No I dont have any pets I was so lonely Maybe I should think about getting one to take with me
7812,sad,Dang thats quite a large amount of money to lose Hopefully it went to someone who needs it
7813,sad,That would be nice Maybe hell go and buy some candy from the candy store
7814,sad,Yeah thats what I was thinking It was in a neighborhood so hopefully some kid found it and can buy something he always wanted
7836,sad,Aw that sucks Everyone gets old eventually how old is shehe
7837,sad,Thats good to hear I hope he feels and gets better
7838,sad,Hes 15 hes small though so I think hes handling it better than the bigger dogs
7845,lonely,Thats too bad Its nice to have friends to revel in our victories Why dont you get yourself a beer and relax on the porch
7846,lonely,If you need someone to join in just let me know
7847,lonely,That sounds like a wonderful idea I will do that
7878,lonely,Oh wow Maybe they were busy doing other things Did you find anyone else to play with
7879,lonely,Sometimes playing by ourselves is how we get better
7880,lonely,I think I played solo by myself but it is what it is
7895,sad,Wow thats unfortunate People dont realize that can happen but it happened to my friend when we were little
7896,sad,Sorry to hear that recovering from any pet lose is hard
7897,sad,Yeah I think its just because Im so fat that I couldnt chase the little runt He was so much faster than me I was so disheartened and out of breath
7928,lonely,Well there are always bigger fish in the sea trust me
7929,lonely,That is also very important to learn
7930,lonely,Thank you maybe I need to learn to love myself first
7931,sad,That sucks do you feel better now
7932,sad,Yeah isolation can happen when you get super sad At least you are feeling better now
7933,sad,I do But i never thought i would shut myself out that much
7949,sad,Ouch that stinks man why she do it
7950,sad,That is even worse Like why would someone just do that when commited to someone
7951,sad,No one knows and she will not tell me
7952,sad,If I knew i would tell you all about it
7974,lonely,Myself as well friends are what make life better
7975,lonely,Alone time is important but you will go crazy if you are always alone
7976,lonely,I usually like being by myself but its taking a toll on my social life now
7996,sad,Have you seen any recently It is really sad what gets me the most is hearing about black bears being hit
7997,sad,Poor thing its not fair Drivers need to watch out
7998,sad,Yes I saw one this morning It was rotting and crows were feeding on it so sad
8087,lonely,Oh no Im so sorry to hear that Are you thinking about getting another one
8088,lonely,Oh I understand They say time heals all wounds I hope it does in your case as well
8089,lonely,No I couldnt do that
8262,sad,Oh no the poor little thing Your nieces must be devastated
8263,sad,Oh no that happened to my dogs One died before the other and the other was so depressed she quickly followed
8264,sad,She was upset But I feel for the one left behind They were sisters
8277,lonely,New hobby Maybe surfing or hiking
8278,lonely,Your never to old I thought my father to surf at 67 years old Your die sitting in front of a puzzle How about Yoga or painting class 
8279,lonely,Yoga is low impact They have classes for all ages and levels It will be a reason to get up and help you stay healthy longer
8280,lonely,Im too old for that I think Ill buy a bunch of jugsaw puzzles
8281,lonely,Yoga oh lord Painting sounds fun though
8282,lonely,I think Ill look into it Seriously
8295,sad,Oh that is so tough I am sorry Are you all right
8296,sad,Thats where you really do have to make the decision for the animal not us  that doesnt make it easier when it happens Do you have other pets
8297,sad,Its so hard because we have had her since I was in 1st grade She was so old and sick
8304,lonely,That had to be disappointing Will you be able to go at another time
8305,lonely,At least you have something to look forward to
8306,lonely,Yea definitely I hope we get another time sooner than later
8325,lonely,Is that a good thing or a bad thing
8326,lonely,Are there any social groups you can join to have some company
8327,lonely,Bad as there is no one to share my thoughts and relieve stress with
8367,sad,Oh no do you at least have food
8368,sad,Ramen is delicious I eat them even when Im not worrying about money
8369,sad,Yeah  I have some raman  Thats all anyone really needs right

8505,sad,Me too I love summer weather and vibes so much
8506,sad,I know the free time is the best You can do whatever you want whenever
8507,sad,The fall weather is nice but there is so much more free time in summer I miss it every time it leaves
8508,sad,now school is about to start I just want to die
8540,lonely,I feel you my brother is my roommate and my friend too 
8541,lonely,That sucks why did she move out
8542,lonely,Now I keep getting random neighbors who get evicted after two months

8608,lonely,I bet you find someone soon
8609,lonely,I have been there too it will get better
8610,lonely,Thanks but its so discouraging seeing happy couples everywhere
8645,lonely,Who did you invite
8646,lonely,Where was the party
8647,lonely,I didnt invite anyone in particular but it was a message to everyone on my followers list 
8648,sad,October I thought most Call of Duty games come out in November

8671,sad,People do that sometimes and it is really sad
8672,sad,Thanks it was so weird because she showed signs of interest But she gave me the Nope
8698,sad,You can always give them some money once you get yourself back on your feet Just keep your head up  things will get better
8699,sad,If I ever meet you I will toss a few bucks your way We all have to help each other out in this tough world
8700,sad,Thank you I always try to give them a few coins here and there Maybe even a few bucks
8775,sad,How did that experience go
8776,sad,Im very glad and I understand how the memories are
8777,sad,It went well but I am gonna miss that farm house We have a lot of memories of that ole place
8784,sad,What can you lose
8785,sad,You do I mean it can only go one of two ways And if it goes one way you can try again with another girl
8786,sad,Probably nothing but its still hard to go through with it I need to man up
8791,sad,That happened to me too when I was in elementary school I lost all my friends and had to make new ones which sucks
8792,sad,I agree
8793,sad,It is really tough at that age too
8827,lonely,Really Thats one of the saddest things Ive heard in a while Im sorry to hear that What happened to your family if you dont mind me asking
8828,lonely,I am terribly sorry to hear that Youve got to be really resilient to deal with that Maybe you could volunteer at a soup kitchen during Thanksgiving so you could have a chance to be around others
8829,lonely,They all died when i was much younger
8852,lonely,Why dont you move back
8853,lonely,Can you make new friends where you are now
8854,lonely,Its better for my kids and its so expensive
8855,lonely,The people out here arent that friendly I cant win
8872,sad,Oh no Did it ever come back
8873,sad,That sucks MY sisters dog used to roam the neighborhood a lot and one day he didnt come back either His name was Oreo I told my daughter he got married
8874,sad,No I assume he died
8879,sad,Awwww  i can relate to that  I am so sorry
8880,sad,I am very sorry to hear that
8881,sad,Yes she died of lung cancer
8892,lonely,You may have more than you know but sometimes meeting new people will give you the fresh start you need
8893,lonely,Neighbors coworkers  Try and get involved in local sports or comunity groups  How about volunteering  That is a good way to meet people that are positive
8894,lonely,Where do I go to meet them
8912,sad,Im sorry to hear that Why do you think that is Is it a painful or happy memory
8913,sad,I can understand that That does sound like a difficult thing to deal with Hopefully you have a lot of nice memories you can look back on to remember her by
8914,sad,I am just sad she isnt alive anymore
8924,lonely,Dang thats rough Like a doubledose of sadness My girlfriend and I are long distance so I know how that goes Is there any way you can still keep in touch with them
8925,lonely,Yeah she and I dont use social media but I can imagine thatd be really helpful in your case Well Im glad you at least have that And maybe it will open up the possibility for you to meet new people too
8926,lonely,Well we dont like unnecessary attention and we dont like talking about ourselves We just like skyping between each other and thats it And talking on the phone of course
8927,lonely,Oh yeah knowing that they left for positive reasons and having social media to keep in contact helps a lot
8928,lonely,How come you guys dont use social media I guess I kind of get it but I feel in your case it could be a huge positive
8929,lonely,Well thats good Skype is actually even better than having to deal with all the extra nastiness of social media
8933,lonely,That is a little daunting  Have you considered joining some groups with likeminded individuals
8934,lonely,Check with your community center
8935,lonely,Yes but I do not know where to go
8952,sad,That is so sad Did the kitten die I hope not
8953,sad,Oh I hope it was ok I understand you not being able to stop
8954,sad,I am not sure as I could not stop because of all the traffic
9009,sad,That is rough news  How long
9010,sad,That is hard  I am so sorry
9011,sad,A year I cant even visit
9041,lonely,What does he do for work
9042,lonely,Well you could always pick up a new hobby What is something youve always wanted to learn
9043,lonely,He builds computers He will be gone for 2 months I dont know what to do
9096,sad,Yes when I was little
9097,sad,I also had a dog did you find your dog
9098,sad,My dog ran away today What kind of pet did you have as a kid
9099,sad,Unfortunately I did not What do you think I should do
9139,lonely,Do you enjoy your free time or are you sad
9140,lonely,Im sorry to hear that
9141,lonely,I am sad most of the time when they are gone
9145,sad,Did you get sleepy while studying
9146,sad,i would have fallen asleep for sure
9147,sad,I had lots of coffee so I did not I was very focused on studying
9151,lonely,That is understandable  You need to let it happen naturally Be with your friends and find yourself
9152,lonely,I understand  It will happen for you if you keep an open mind and dont rush
9153,lonely,thank you I appreciate that I just yearn for that company too you know

9448,sad,DEfinitely
9449,sad,I am looking but its not going well 
9450,sad,I know all of those things lol Just alone every day can get to you
9451,sad,It will happen eventualy
9513,sad,I havent seen it but I know a lot of people like it 
9514,sad,Sounds good were you said throughout the series or because of an ending
9515,sad,I appreciate that I wish I had watched it so you could talk more about it 
9516,sad,Yeah  its a bit like an old HBO show called Oz
9517,sad,Because of an ending  I dont want to spoil it for you though
9521,sad,Im sorry to hear that Are you OK
9522,sad,Oh man Thats so sad

9691,sad,yes that can be a huge problem Im so sorry youre having to go through that
9692,sad,Of course Ive felt sad for many reasons Things that happen in the world make me sad
9693,sad,What makes me sad is hunger in the world I cannot stand people suffering
9694,sad,I have to be away and I am not able to play with my son
9695,sad,NO problemHAve you ever fell sad
9696,sad,Do you recall something that makes you really sad

10025,lonely,hi thats sad have you tried looking for facebook events like local events i bet you can meet people there
10026,lonely,You can always talk to me im here for you
10027,lonely,I have but no one wants to meet me I sit in my room by myself on weekends
10043,sad,im sorry to hear that i hate when my wife and i argue are you feeling any better did you have a chance to talk to your husband after that
10044,sad,i hope everything will go back to normal asap and i hope he will apologize for making you feel small
10045,sad,He woke this morning not saying anything but I know its got to be on his mind  Mostly we just keep to ourselves until one of us speaks about something off the conversation then we slowly ease back into being the same  Im feeling a little better  I know he doesnt mean the things he says
10046,sad,Awwwwe thank you for listening  Sometimes it just feels better to get it out  Im sure I will be alright  Got my big girl panties on here  LOL  Besides after being together 13 years  Were bound to argue at some point in time
10056,sad,did you drink a lot back then 
10057,sad,i am glad you are in a better place now
10058,sad,I have never been an alcoholic but I never drank that much
10106,sad,Oh man so sorry dude Hope your coping
10107,sad,Why did she break up with you Was it a long term relationship 
10108,sad,Thanks I am trying I am just very upset
10145,sad,Its alright maybe its a working day and she has a surprise for you on saturday
10146,sad,Did you check everywhere in the room maybe she has a surprise  gift hidden somewhere for you to find out
10147,sad,Yea maybe but I am still upset She did not even wish my happy birthday
10193,lonely,That sucks  Its the same for me only its because we recently moved and I dont know anyone outside of work yet
10194,lonely,Ouch  Were you too busy to go with them
10195,lonely,Wife and kids went to see family and my friends went hunting without me
10199,sad,I know that was the case for many I am sorry that impacted you 
10200,sad,Many people did he was a likeable fellow
10201,sad,i use to follow him since i was a kid
10205,sad,That makes me sad to hear  Do you have lots of friends now
10206,sad,I think it is better to a few really good friends than a lot of acquaintances
10207,sad,Not a lot but I have a good group of a few friends so that is nice
10302,sad,I am very sorry for your loss
10303,sad,A loss is never easy especially one in the family
10304,sad,Thank you  It was a long time ago but I still think about her a lot  She had a big impact on my life
10334,lonely,Is it something you enjoy 
10335,lonely,I know we are all different but maybe getting another puppy would help 
10336,lonely,Well my dog just passed away so now its just me I am having a hard time getting used to it
10377,lonely,I would enjoy the peace and quiet  Kick back relax and do whatever you want
10378,lonely,Well in that case I hope they come home soon  My family is just annoying mostly
10379,lonely,Its just not the same without them around I miss them
10416,lonely,Oh Im sorry to hear that The only thing that helps is time unfortunately
10417,lonely,After some time passes though youll wonder why you were so sad
10418,lonely,Indeed I think time is the only heal to emotional wounds
10461,sad,I am sorry to hear that I know that would be hard
10462,sad,I hope things get better for you
10463,sad,My family is supportive but I still feel bad
10488,lonely,That sucks but being lonely can sometimes help you discover new hobbies
10489,lonely,Yes your happiness doesnt depend on nobody else
10490,lonely,It was horrible and boring but Im hoping to take up a hobby soon so I can have something to do when hes away
10608,sad,That is really sad Many people I grew up with have passed from overdose Its tragic
10609,sad,I dont believe it is either Im so sorry to hear about your friend
10610,sad,I agree I thought the war on drugs was meant to combat or maybe even make ground against this I dont think it is working 
10831,sad,That would be tough Have you found a support group to go too
10832,sad,That would be difficult I cant imagine the pain you must be going through Sounds like yall have good memories together
10833,sad,That sounds like a great gandma You are so blessed to have those memories with her
10834,sad,My mom thinks that her grandmas spirit is in me because she died right before I was born
10835,sad,No it isnt that bad Its just grief of losing my grandmother She was 93 and lived a very full and exciting life Its just hard to know she is no longer here 
10836,sad,We did She always had her own garden and taught me all kinds of skills related to farming preparing and canning food She was an awesome person 
10837,sad,Thanks I agree I will miss her but I will always have her spirit with me 
10851,lonely,Whats wrong Did anything happen Have you reached out to any friends lately
10852,lonely,Aw man Im sorry That sounds rough I know how you feel Time usually helps but its pretty gradual Hang in there
10853,lonely,My wife left me a month agoMy friends are trying to help mebut its not working
10951,lonely,That sucks Maybe you can find yourself a new hobby that will keep you occupied while hes gone
10952,lonely,Thats understandable Id probably feel the same way in the same situation
10953,lonely,I mostly just have been baking and reading relaxing and just having some me time but I just miss him haha 
10957,lonely,So you guys probably dont get along very well
10958,lonely,Does the wife hate you
10959,lonely,We havent talked in awhile but I think thats because of his soon to be wife Ive never felt so alone without my family
11029,sad,Oh no I am sorry to hear that Is she feeling any better
11030,sad,That must have been unpleasant for her I am glad to hear that she is feeling better
11031,sad,Shes a lot better now at least can eat solid foods before it was only yogurt and soups she could swallow I was doing her injections twice a day
11062,sad,Thats a downer man Who do you think was the perpetrator
11063,sad,That really sucks man Did he ever apologize to you and give the money back
11064,sad,It was the guy I thought was my best friend I was so devastated I didnt care about the money but the fact he would stead from me 
11130,sad,Oh no I am so sorry to hear that That must be so hard How have you been coping
11131,sad,Oh wow that is so sad Have you contacted an attorney
11132,sad,One step at a time basically I hate he couldnt get a good doctor but that was the best the VA could do
11133,sad,No they covered their butts really well with paperwork It wasnt worth it sadly 
11252,lonely,Im sorry to hear that Ive felt similar before
11253,lonely,Did they every tell you why they left without you
11254,lonely,Yeah I was pretty miserable until they got home but then I felt much better
11255,sad,Im so sorry to hear that I lost my cat recently too 
11256,sad,Thats a great name  My cats name was Midnight I had him it seemed forever How long did you have yours
11257,sad,His name was Sylvestre what was your cats name
11258,sad,I had him for just 2 years he was a baby 
11284,sad,Oh wow I am so sorry to hear that May I ask what happened
11285,sad,Oh well Im sure she was worried but disowning you doesnt help And now she wont know your child Thats very sad 
11286,sad,Well she was upset at me for running away and having a baby as a teen
11392,lonely,Im sorry to hear that  What do they get treatment for
11393,lonely,Im sure thats really tough  I hope he appreciates all that youre doing for him and Im sure itll work out 
11394,lonely,Oh he just has a lot of trauma from childhood and he takes a lot out on me so he has to get help in order for anything to continue between us
11395,lonely,Thank you You are so sweet I hope so too 
11441,lonely,Leaving you why
11442,lonely,OK now I understand
11443,lonely,She is starting school Im going to be all alone
11444,lonely,She is too young to leave the state but she is an adult
11473,sad,I have seen them
11474,sad,I am not sure I believe them most of the time though
11475,sad,I watched on last night It mafe me so sad
11476,sad,Really That seems like a lot
11480,sad,I am sorry how old was it
11481,sad,That is a lot of memories
11482,sad,I had him for 15 years
11483,sad,Indeed it is Its been many years     Do you have any pets
11492,sad,yes I do Do you
11493,sad,Is that a good or a bad thing
11494,sad,No not anymore
11495,sad,Bad at first but good to find someone better its hard to find someone though
11532,lonely,having a few good friends or even one is better then having a bunch of fake ones It is hard to make friends as an adult that are true friends even if you are great at it So dont feel bad
11533,lonely,I understand I used to be the social butterfly but now after a lot of trauma I am very anxious as well and I dont care to have people I dont trust around me anyhow Maybe try meetups or forums where people have the same interests
11534,lonely,thank you for your support I have a really good friend but he lives in a different state so we dont see each other that often
11581,sad,Death can happen in an INSTANT I have been there the past year I am sorry
11582,sad,Me too So sorry Life doesnt get any easier Its just about trying to enjoy every day
11583,sad,Yeah I have experience a lot of that recently
11679,sad,Oh man I am so sorry You must be devastated
11680,sad,Oh manI just had someone go through that It is horrifying Yes a long battle can be good or bad I am sorry
11681,sad,Yeah its pretty bad She had cancer and they didnt see it late  Atleast it was pretty fast
11682,sad,She went to the hospital and the whole thing start to finish was under a month  They did a week of chemo and it didnt work
11704,sad,I feel the same I hate apple products I refuse to use them
11705,sad,I didnt know that Another reason to not like them
11706,sad,and everything the release they claim tis groundbreaking wile other phones had the same features for eyars
11744,lonely,Oh thats a bummer Do you go to college locally
11745,lonely,Oh great I am not a big fan of college anyway Maybe you will find a new love while they are away 
11746,lonely,I dont Im working right now because Im not sure what I want to major in
11756,sad,Thats unfortunate How many animals did you have
11757,sad,What kind of animals were they
11758,sad,I had 2 I had them for years It really sucked but we tried for almost 2 years and her allergies were insanely bad to the point of hospital visits 
11759,lonely,ugh for the better or worst How are you feeling 
11760,lonely,If you are feeling that way then it probably is On to a fresh start 
11761,lonely,A pretty big mix  Its probably best its over
11762,lonely,Indeed time to get back into the dating scene
11777,sad,That is so sad  I would be so mad at the drunk driver  How could he live with himself
11778,sad,I agree  There is no excuse for that to have happened  Such a tragedy
11779,sad,Who knows I hope he gets the book thrown at him
11811,sad,What happened
11812,sad,Im sorry you must miss them a lot if you dont see them as much as you used to
11813,sad,She moved all the way across the city I hardly see my neice anymore
11814,sad,Yes I do My niece Not my sister lol
11858,lonely,That seems like itd be strange
11859,lonely,well you could always have left
11860,lonely,Yeah it was weird When I joined it said 325 people but when I got in it there was no one 
11883,sad,Sorry to hear that Whats wrong
11884,sad,I know that feeling it will get better Just gotta stay positive
11885,sad,Finances mostly stressing me out
11946,sad,That sucks I love my mom so much I cant imagine her being dead
11947,sad,I will def do that I need to be more grateful for while she is alive Thank you for that
11948,sad,I am sure you already do but just spoil her a lot and always let her know you care I wish I had more time to do all of those things for her 
11998,lonely,Wow they dont sound like good friends to me 
11999,lonely,You should give them the cold shoulder next time you see them Thats what I would do
12000,lonely,Yeah it made me feel really bad especially since im new to the area 
12063,lonely,How long are we talking about 
12064,lonely,Sounds like you know what to do
12065,lonely,A couple years I think its mainly my fault though for not putting myself out there
12196,lonely,Me too I feel you bro Its ok at least make sure you are being productive
12197,lonely,Try joining clubs or finding hobbies Or you can always make friends on online video games
12198,lonely,I do But I dont have any friends out here
12199,lonely,I have plenty of online friends I didnt count them lol
12467,sad,Thats tough its good he has a friend like you to help him out though
12468,sad,Its good you have a close friend to count on too if needed
12469,sad,Yea it happens Hes been there for me too
12501,lonely,Im so sorry I know the feeling Im really sorry
12502,lonely,Yes I grew up with him and he got me through my parents splitting up and everything cause I didnt have many friends I know everyone always says dont get another one too soon but for both my cats that passed and my dog doing that really is what got me out of the rut 
12503,lonely,Its ok Not your fault So you have lost one too
12528,lonely,I am sorry why did you break up
12529,lonely,That is not fun sorry to hear that
12530,lonely,We were just growing apart too much
12579,lonely,People come into our lives for a reason sometimes
12580,lonely,Im glad they were for positive reasons for you
12581,lonely,That is true we just never know why
12633,lonely,When did you meet them
12634,lonely,Nice How long have you all been together
12635,lonely,In high school and college
12660,lonely,i like alone time
12661,lonely,i think its good to find a healthy balance between being alone and being social
12662,lonely,I used to like alone time but now not so much
12666,sad,Why not You only live once get out Make the most out of every day
12667,sad,Sorry to hear that How did you meet your lady friend
12668,sad,That is true I was just depressed
12690,lonely,Im sorry to hear that Is there anyone around in your life
12691,lonely,Thats horrible I hope youre trying to do some fun things to take your mind off the pain
12692,lonely,My wife left me after 15 years together
12736,sad,Thats always disappointing What were you wanting to buy
12737,sad,Thats too bad
12738,sad,There were breats on sale They are rarely that cheap
12972,sad,That is really a shame  Too bad they wont get help for the kids
12973,sad,You would think they would be motivated to keep their kids
12974,sad,I think theyll be forced to eventually Theyve already had the department of social services involved but they always end up getting the children back At some point reality is really going to set in and theyll lose their children
12975,sad,That is so disappointing Will you stay there
12976,sad,Thats too bad Maybe explore some other options and see how you feel
12977,sad,Im not sure Im so depressed that I dont know what to do now
13132,sad,Im sorry to hear that
13133,sad,It will get better I know that is a tough thing
13134,sad,Thank you I hope I feel better soon
13178,lonely,Did you move to the country
13179,lonely,Well you have to be safe
13180,lonely,Then you definitely have to be dafe
13181,lonely,Of course lol
13182,lonely,Not really Further outside of the city though The neighborhood was getting rough
13183,lonely,Plus I have kids
13184,lonely,I think you mean safe
13189,lonely,oh no what did you do
13190,lonely,wow you are a brave soul
13191,lonely,I found some hobbies and eventually got through it
13295,lonely,Hey that makes for peaceful living doesnt it
13296,lonely,Wow   WHY  LOL  Thats crazy
13297,lonely,haha  Murder documentaries are my favorite too
13298,lonely,Its lonely and I always think Im going to be murdered and end up on 2020
13299,lonely,I watch those shows too much
13300,lonely,They are too good to not watch
13327,sad,that sucks
13328,sad,Tell her its okay
13329,sad,Yeah shes not getting any younger too
13391,sad,oh no that is not cool
13392,sad,I commend you for admitting your fault in it
13393,sad,No I am poor so its a big deal However she did it absent mindedly as they were in a big package Still I shouldnt have gotten so mad
13436,sad,That is too bad Are they getting along now
13437,sad,Are they okay now
13438,sad,Not quite Theyre not aggressive with one another but they still havent completely gotten back to the point where theyre acting normal I guess its just a matter of time Theyve been together four years and that was the worst fight yet
13439,sad,Yeah theyre fine Thanks for asking
13443,lonely,I often dream of ending my own life because of being alone
13444,lonely,I often times wish I didnt have any family and friends would make things easier
13445,lonely,Yeah I get those thoughts sometimes too but I feel like doing that would be so selfish We need to think of our family and friends and how much they care about us
13492,sad,oh im sorry to here that always good to see family
13493,sad,hopefully things get better for you
13494,sad,Yeah  Seems like theyre dropping like flies up there  Wont have much family left in illinois if this keeps happening

13587,lonely,its all good  i still have my imaginary friend
13591,sad,What happened

13593,sad,I was diagnosed with cancer and needed help with my kids during treatments
13661,lonely,what are you gonna do partyyyyy
13662,lonely,that sucks
13663,lonely,I dont know what to do Its so quiet here and nothing to do
13664,lonely,I know what you mean Thats no fun
13665,lonely,Do you have any hobbies or do you like to read
13666,lonely,yea boring sometimes
13676,lonely,Where did they go
13677,lonely,What did you do while they are gone
13678,lonely,They went to Mystic CT I feel so lost and bored without them here
13725,lonely,Im sorry that you feel lonely
13726,lonely,Absolutely never be a victim
13727,lonely,Thanks I dont like it a lot but its better then living with abuse right
13746,lonely,I wish that was not the case I would have came
13747,lonely,I hope you have much brighter days moving forward
13748,lonely,Thats so thoughtful of you to say  Made my day brighter
13752,lonely,Is that relaxing to you or lonely 
13753,lonely,Try to enjoy the quiet but not get down
13754,lonely,It is both in a way more so the second than anything
13755,lonely,I am not used to the quiet My children have extreme strong lungs Enough to cause me migraines all day haha every day almost
13783,sad,That is so sad I am sorry
13784,sad,Thats a very nice way to think of it
13785,sad,Its okay  funerals are always a sad time but we all get through it
13795,lonely,Oh is the new extra space a good thing
13796,lonely,I can imagine that being a bit lonely
13797,lonely,Maybe but I have never lived alone before It is very quiet and weird
13810,sad, Oh my gosh seriously
13811,sad,I am so sorry ab out that I hope things get better soon
13812,sad,I cant believe how hurt I am about it
13840,lonely,Why did you go to the movies by yourself
13841,lonely,That is great being so independent
13842,lonely,I didnt have anyone to go with during the afternoon and I really wanted to check the film out
13843,lonely,Yeah its similar to eating at a restaurant by yourself It can feel a bit sad though
13866,sad,Where are you going
13867,sad,Oh thats never fun I hate that too
13868,sad,I have to go back to my rountine work I am so sad about it I wish the holiday can continue and for the first time I found love during a holiday
13872,sad,How does it make you feel when you think about them
13873,sad,Aww I am sorry to hear that I hope you can regain contact with them someday Im sure theyd love to hear from you
13874,sad,I feel so depressed and I miss them a ton
13875,lonely,Why is that
13876,lonely,Oh maybe you should try joining  achurch
13877,lonely,I dont have anyone to hang out with where I live now
13881,sad,Oh no thats terrible Can it be replaced
13882,sad,What kind was it
13883,sad,Fortunately yes it just sucks because it was brand new
13938,lonely,Awh that really bites Its the worst when it feels like everyone is having fun without you
13939,lonely,Thats right It will all pay off for you in a few years
13940,lonely,Yea it really is They seem like they are having a lot of fun but I am doing what is best for me
13992,lonely,sorry about that you could have called a friend
13993,lonely,yah or get a comedy or get to watch a movie
13994,lonely,Yes I didnt think about that I will do that next time
14027,sad,Why Was it because you didnt take those last few moments to spend time with her Sometimes we have so much going on we dont have time to do it all
14028,sad,Oh no Im sorry to hear that You had no idea that would be the last visit but I can understand how you would feel that way I have no doubt she understood why you didnt though
14029,sad,I had an emergency at work I am a doctor and it was a life and death situation  but now I regret because I could have assigned someone else and driven my mother because that was her life visit 
14061,sad,Oh my gosh thats such a heavy thing to think about Did you ask her or confront her
14062,sad,Well I hope theyve figured it out together during this time 
14063,sad,Yes but she denies it 
14064,sad,They stayed together 39 years and then my dad passed
14085,sad,Oh no Are you thinking about buying another one
14086,sad,The meaningfulness is definitely something you can never replace I hope that it shows up and if not I hope this watch brings meaning to your life in new ways
14087,sad,Unfortunatly yes But that one had a lot of meaning to me as it was my fathers It hurts to not have it anymore
14101,sad,You will be fine just get a new one
14102,sad,I understand how you feel I used to have one like that when It passed away I got a puppy of the same exact breed and gave it the same name with a few month It looked like the one that passed away so It helped me to forget 
14103,sad,Thanks but I wont
14124,sad,Whats got you feeling down
14125,sad,How inconvenient Are you going to take it to a technician
14126,sad,My computer suddenly stopped working yesterday and I cant figure out why
14127,sad,Yes I think that is my logical next step to get it fixed I hope they can fix it
14134,lonely,That can be sad but luckily you can plan to visit them in the future
14135,lonely,Yes using social media really helps us connect with friends and family so much better
14136,lonely,I do But for now I do miss them and it makes me feel sad that they arent around in person Social media does help though
14316,lonely,Oh no  Dont say that  I start a new job today
14317,lonely,Why dont you talk to yours  Im so sorry
14318,lonely,Youll be alright make sure to talk to your coworkers or youll feel lonely like me
14337,lonely,You must felt really lonely because you need friends in college
14338,lonely,I bet it can I had no friends in college either
14339,lonely,yep it really did get quite lonesome at times
14346,lonely,Where did you land in then India or something
14347,lonely,Aw well that seems like it would be a great time I hear the beaches are beautiful
14348,lonely,Wow what a great guess Haha Thailand actually
14386,lonely,ok how did you manage the situation
14387,lonely,I think you should have talked to the hostel management to help you out on this as well
14388,lonely,it was hard since i didnt have many friends at the time got quite lonesome
14396,lonely,Theyre not very good friends then You should confront them about this
14397,lonely,Could be hopefully the wont dismiss you like that in the future
14398,lonely,Maybe I will I figured they were just all truly busy
14487,lonely,Your dog doesnt keep you good company
14488,lonely,I guess so but it should be able to alleviate a lot of that loneliness
14489,lonely,And that should have said LIVE lol  She does but its not the same as having other people to talk to
14538,lonely,Im really sorry to hear that How long did you have it for
14539,lonely,Thats really tough right now I hope youre doing something fun to keep yourself occupied
14540,lonely,It been 2 days now 
14568,lonely,why arent you taking a vacation with them
14569,lonely,perhaps you could invite someone over to your place and watch a cool movie with them over a pizza
14570,lonely,I didnt have money or time to plan anything
14593,lonely,a better school
14594,lonely,oh that stinks
14595,lonely,They thought it was a better school and it probably was but I didnt feel like it was at the time
14596,lonely,I remember after the first day wondering if I would ever have any friends there
14635,sad,Oh  Where is she going
14636,sad,Aww man  That is a long time to be without your wife  I bet youre going to miss her 
14637,sad,She is going on a work trip for 2 months I am upset at this
14647,lonely,Oh Im sorry Have you tried to talk to people
14648,lonely,You can try again to reach out to people Otherwise remember that it is only temporary soon you will be in a different class with more opportunities to make friends  
14649,lonely,I have but they do not like me I sit alone at lunch every day because of this
14713,sad,I understand
14714,sad,Then you need to take a break 
14715,sad,Im not sure how to snap out of it I at times like my own space but being alone makes me feel depressed
14743,lonely,very true do you live alone now
14744,lonely,i feel you but look on the bright side it makes the moments being together far more special
14745,lonely,No with my wife and daughter but every year they go to Peru to visit her family for a few weeks and it sucks being by yourself 
14792,lonely,Why not Whats going on 
14793,lonely,Happens to the best of us we are only human Dont take it in a bad way im sure its been real nice being alone 
14794,lonely,Nothing just havent felt like getting out lately
14825,sad,Are you going to have any other roommate or you will be living alone
14826,sad,Maybe you can post an ad on Craigslist That way many will see and be interested 
14827,sad,Ill be by myself so I need to find another roomate Im not really sure about the best way to do that though I had enough randoms in college
14845,sad,Thats great Do you visit the casino often
14846,sad,Yeah I dont have the best luck in casinos either
14847,sad,Not really I dont like losing money The job is transferring her to Vegas though She is moving soon
14848,sad,I am going to miss her She is my best friend for 10 years
14890,sad,I hope you called the cops on him
14891,sad,Good because hes no good for you You deserve better
14892,sad,i did I am going to move before I am evicted I dont want him to know where I live
14893,sad,I know He screwed up
14897,lonely,its a gift and a curse as they say
14898,lonely,thats very true
14899,lonely,As is much of life but its better to live alone right now and not be abused I guess Ill take lonely over abuse 
14904,lonely,Wow Where did they go
14905,lonely,Aw You miss her Thats sweet My daughter wont leave the house so I can miss her lol
14906,lonely,They went to Coco beach It is so quiet and boring here without her
14917,lonely,Dont say that There is somebody for every single person on this earth
14918,lonely,Dont force it They usually come around when your not looking
14919,lonely,Where is my person
14920,lonely,I am just tired of looking now

15017,sad,Hes a miniature pinscher very small
15071,lonely,Break ups normally have that affect 
15072,lonely,yes It is not easy at all It will get better one day at time 
15073,lonely,Yeah I know that now for sure
15080,lonely,It is eerie isnt it You must have felt quite strange Hope your poor doggie is ok
15081,lonely,That mustve been terrifying for you Its amazing how we can hear every little thing around us when were alone
15082,lonely,Yes she recovered well Yes it was strange I was jumping at every sound because I knew I was the only living thing in the house or was I 
15105,lonely,I am so sorry to hear that Dealing with the loss of a loved one is always difficult but feeling alone in the grief must be so much worse I hope that you are feeling less alone now
15106,lonely,I am sure that it did Were you very close with your father
15107,lonely,I am it took awhile but I got through it
15140,sad,Its hard to make this decision  Im sorry  Whats your pets name
15141,sad,Omar sure will have some new owners who will love it
15142,sad,Omar was his name
15190,sad,Oh mine too he is 12 and lost eye sight
15191,sad,Wow 15 cant do nothing but love them
15192,sad,Its unfortunate mine just turned 15
15200,sad,Thats terrible Did he at least live a good life
15201,sad,Oh man Be sure to give em a proper sendoff 
15202,sad,He did live for 12 years but apparently i wasnt told til now and he died 2 weeks ago
15237,lonely,Did you try watching movies or playing video games
15238,lonely,I understand
15239,lonely,Yeah me and my dog watched TV but still I go crazy sometimes being alone
15243,lonely,Sometimes being alone can be a good thing though
15244,lonely,Well I am sure it was a good experience
15245,lonely,Yeah it was just a bit eerie without any human interactions I actually missed having someone to talk to
15249,lonely,That would be discouraging  Did you make new friends
15250,lonely,Thats no fun Hopefully you got some stuff done around the house then
15251,lonely,Not at point 
15347,lonely,That sucks  Bowling is definitely a hang out with friends kind of sport 
15348,lonely,You should join a league and meet some friends with similar interests
15349,lonely,Yeah none of my friends wanted to go for some reason I was so sad and alone
15507,sad,You must see them a lot
15508,sad,At least you can talk on the phone
15509,sad,Not yet because she still lives so close but next week she is moving an 11 hour drive away from me It is going to be so hard
15539,sad,Are you the mother or father Time flies so fast
15540,sad,I bet she is going to be a great person when she is older
15541,sad,Im mom She is taller than me now I wish she was 4 again
15542,sad,I hope so She is pretty awesome now
15559,lonely,Really Which one was it 
15560,lonely,Was that in the United States or somewhere else I used to love All My Children and General Hospital 
15561,lonely,Sounds like fun I wonder if you could find old episodes online now 
15562,lonely,Oh cool Any names I might know
15563,lonely,Passions
15564,lonely,It was in the US it had a bunch of young people on it We would all talk about it at school the next day
15565,lonely,Probably A lot of the actors have gone on to be in big movies
15566,sad,I was just talking about this with my friend They are getting too old
15567,sad,i know right
15568,sad,I know they have to grow up and all but cant they stay littles for a little bit longer
15790,sad,Where did you move to
15791,sad,Im sorry I moved once from MD to FL so I know how you feel being without your peeps
15792,sad,Just to the suburbs but its a log drive I miss my friends already
15793,sad,Wow thats a big difference
15828,lonely,How so Just used to the way things are
15829,lonely,Oh no are there things you could do outside of your comfort zone Things you never considered before
15830,lonely,I think so I feel like I have done everything and I am so alone
15831,lonely,That actually sounds like a good idea I could meet some new people
15892,sad,I like being emotional
15893,sad,I bet  Its probably cheaper than therapy though
15894,sad,Well I have watched likt 10 this week They can really move you
15895,sad,Lol Thats so true
15901,lonely,I would imagine so  It is difficult to be away from family for long
15902,lonely,That would probably do the trick  If not video call your family to touch base more often
15903,lonely,I will try get out with friends to feel less lonely
16066,sad,Are you a helicopter parent  Do you spin
16067,sad,Maybe you have went so long without hanging with your friends you forgot you had them
16068,sad,No I miss my kids when they go with their friends lol
16069,sad,Thats probably true lol
16110,sad,What did that do 
16111,sad,I am sorry that someone did that to you
16112,sad,I allowed them back in too rebuildand they ruined it again So I really dont know if Ill ever let them back in again
16168,lonely,Im great how are you doing
16169,lonely,Whats wrong
16170,lonely,ive been feeling better since i just got payed  been a little bummed
16171,lonely,just broke up with my girlfriend recently  but it was totally my fault 
16287,lonely,I am sorry that you had to go through that  
16288,lonely,That is too bad  It sounds like you need some knew people to surround you
16289,lonely,Oh we all have I am sure  Thanks but then the person who is trying to build trust with me acted like a fill in the blank and I wasnt so lonely anymore I remembered why I prefer being alone
16326,sad,which country
16327,sad,thats cool i bet she will have fun
16328,sad,Shell be in England
16398,lonely,thats unfortunate sucks missing out on time with your family
16399,lonely,you definitely gotta appreciate them while you can
16400,lonely,It does I feel like I barely get to see them nowadays
16457,sad,Im so sorry to hear that How long ago was this
16458,sad,its terrible to lose someone Was this expected or sudden
16459,sad,This was a few months ago
16466,sad,Oh my gosh Im so sorry to hear that
16467,sad,I know thats gonna to be a terrible loss for the family

16636,lonely,Are you mad at them
16637,lonely,Oh my word I thought bobcats were mythical like unicorns
16638,lonely,Of course I wouldnt have gotten mauled by a bobcat if they came with me Bunch of jerks
16792,lonely,Is that a good or a bad thing
16793,lonely,Aw I am sorry they will be back soon though
16794,lonely,Never bad good mom or dad  They are only young once
16795,lonely,Its bad I miss then
16796,lonely,Tomorrow Im so attached to my kids Its bad lol
16797,lonely,Thats so true
16805,lonely,That must feel awesome
16806,lonely,I feel that way when my kids are gone
16807,lonely,Actually its way too quiet and boring
16811,lonely,Thats understandable What happened
16812,lonely,Thats hard Are they in a new relationship I hope it wasnt a bad breakup
16813,lonely,Thats hard If he was bad to you I hope you are able to get over it if not you can always reach out 
16814,lonely,we broke up a long time ago but we used to be friends before
16815,lonely,IT was bad I have no idea what he is doing now
16816,sad,that sucks
16817,sad,you have to let those people go
16818,sad,Yes Its very sad especially when you know someone was abused for so long and they just keep ruining their lives Almost like they are continuing the abuse on themselves
16822,sad,Thats no good How did that happen
16823,sad,Dang Well I bet that really worked to get your point across haha
16824,sad,I got in a heated conversation and threw it lol
16825,sad,I feel so dumb lol
16927,lonely,How come it felt bad
16928,lonely,That is terrible  WHy
16929,lonely,My friends ditched me They have never done that before
16973,sad,I am sorry I am sure he will be safe
16974,sad,I am sure you are
16975,sad,I am sure too Just still so worried about him 
16979,sad,Oh no Im so sorry  I feel you  I lost my sweet springer spaniel Pepper not long ago Are you coping okay
16980,sad,Well thats a wonderful thing  You had a good time with the first one and this new one will breathe life into your day and pull any sadness away  What will you name it
16981,sad,Im fine I went out and got a new one this evening
17095,lonely,Why did your family leave Sorry that you felt that way
17096,lonely,What did you do all by yourself
17097,lonely,they went to visit other family had the day alone
17098,sad,Oh my god Did you guys have a fight
17099,sad,Its just an extra tomato man Youre going to let that ruin your relationship with your turtle
17100,sad,Yeah he was all butthurt because I wouldnt let him eat an extra tomato Serves him right but I do marginally miss him
17104,lonely,Thats too bad Why were you all alone
17105,lonely,Interesting Why wouldnt they take you along
17106,lonely,family left without me to visit some other relatives
17110,lonely,It was the right thing to do Getting used to not having someone around is going to take some time
17111,lonely,It will take time but Im sure youll be okay
17112,lonely,Yeah I definitely dont want to get back together just because I miss having someone but its definitely hard  Im struggling to find things to do or get out with friends
17128,lonely,Thats so sad Im sorry
17129,lonely,Have you ever tried writing Thats what I do
17130,lonely,thank you Now I dont have anyone really to talk to or do things with 
17140,lonely,Im sorry to hear that Did you find your dog
17141,lonely,Did you try calling your local shelter
17142,lonely,no still missing after 8 days
17143,lonely,Oh no You didnt have anyone to go with
17144,lonely,Wow Thats some friends you have there
17145,lonely,I didnt My friends ditched me It felt pretty bad
17161,lonely,That sounds like it could be fun or was it sad
17162,lonely,Oh no Well those arent such good friends
17163,lonely,It was kinda a bad time All my friends ditched me
17347,lonely,No one came to take care of you
17348,lonely,Was the cat nice I know they can be sassy when they dont get all of the attention lol
17349,lonely,No one just my cat ha
17374,lonely,Thats really too bad I know how that feels Have you tried telling her how you feel about it
17375,lonely,That must be really difficult and lonely for you I hope you guys can get something figured out
17376,lonely,Yeah weve had multiple conversations But it always comes back to her not being able to budge on the time she can commit to her job And with the long distance thing theres less of an immediate necessity for her to change her commitment Its a work in progress
17421,lonely,I am so sorry to hear that  When will you see them again
17422,lonely,That is so sad to hear  I hope things go well with the therapy and you are reunited soon
17423,lonely,It depends on what they do in therapy I cannot live with them they way they have been so its a pickle
17424,lonely,3 Thank you Truly
17438,lonely,I can imagine that Ive never lived alone before
17439,lonely,When did you start living by yourself
17440,lonely,Wow really I have before and now I am again Its hard You wake up and thinkwhat is going on where am IOh yeah
17441,lonely,The past 2 weeks Its a change better then abuse though
17591,lonely,Thats tough I have two older brothers so I know how that is Were separated by four and eight years respectively so we werent as close as you two seem to be but I always liked having them around
17592,lonely,Well absence always does make the heart grow fonder It will make your relationship a little strained but the time you guys do get to spend together maybe will mean more and you can enjoy it more Hopefully his college work doesnt stress him out too much for him to be able to enjoy hanging out
17593,lonely,I feel you me and my brother are really close so it was pretty sad not having him around

19137,sad,True I just left her alone and move on but I do miss her but not much I can do
19203,lonely,Try to put yourself out there  You can also try online dating

19266,sad,Oh my  Im so sorry to hear that  What happened
19267,sad,Thats really sad  I hear about fatal car accidents more and more these days  
19268,sad,He lost control of his car and crashed into a median
19424,sad,Have you thought about speaking with a counselor
19425,sad,Well you should know that your feelings are a normal thing to happen in this event
19426,sad,I dont think its at that point yet but it has been making me feel down pretty often Mostly at night when trying to sleep
19495,sad,Really Any idea how strong it was Any casualties
19496,sad,Thats awful I feel bad for people that have to live in areas prone to natural disasters like that
19497,sad,It was really strong I think many people died
19498,sad,Yes I feel awful for people in such tragedies particularly those that lose loved ones
19519,lonely,Why is that so
19520,lonely,Maybe you could work night shift too and that way you will be able to spend more time together
19521,lonely,You could also got out foe a while and do something fun
19522,lonely,my wife works night shifts as a nurse so i am often home by myself
19523,lonely,Oh thats a good idea I never thought of that
19628,sad,There is nothing silly about that  Movies are meant to illicit emotion  You feel better now though right
19629,sad,Definitely dont feel bad then  I think everyone cried during that movie
19630,sad,Yes yes I do It was The Notebook  I just got really emotional watching it
19631,sad,I am not sure how to deal with the loss

19738,lonely,Did you make any plans to go and visit them
19739,lonely,Maybe you will be able to make some extra money
19740,lonely,i try to go once a year but money is tight right now
19741,lonely,i dont know if i could possibly make more than i am currently
19751,sad,What was your hamsters name
19752,sad,Do you know what it was that happened to kill him
19753,sad,His name was Sparky I reached into his cage to pick him up because he was not moving His poor body was cold I was so tearful
19806,lonely,Aww thats a bummer Well at least you can look forward to his visits
19807,lonely,Depending how far away he is he probably will Just make sure to spoil him when he does lol
19808,lonely,Yes thats true He promised hed come home often to visit
19809,lonely,Sometimes its hard to find that certain someone Have you tried a dating app
19810,lonely,Keep your chin up That special person will come along when youre least expecting it
19811,lonely,It sure is tough Every time I find someone online it turns out there is something weird about them I guess I will be lonely for the rest of my life
19820,sad,Oh Im sorry to hear that were you thinking of buying another one
19821,sad,Well Im glad you have good memories to remember him by
19822,sad,No nothing can replace good old Petey I will mourn him every day and reminisce about the good times we had
19883,lonely,Thats pretty impressive Was it scary to move away from home at such a young age
19884,lonely,Ill bet it was I dont have family around so I know how lonely that can feel
19885,lonely,It was  even though the company I worked for moved us all down here it was still very hard to adjust  I mean being in a big city and not having family around was hard
19990,lonely,Oh Im sorry Have you tried joining any meet up groups to make some friends
19991,lonely,Im sure it will make you feel a little better And at least that way you can pick a group based on similar interest I hope you get to feeling better
19992,lonely,Not yet but that is a good idea I just really need to meet some new people I think
19993,sad,I really liked Logan It was a different kind of superhero movie More about the struggle than anything
19994,sad,The scene with his daughter was pretty sad I dont blame you at all
19995,sad,please dont laugh but i actually cried at the end i could not stop the water works 
20011,lonely,Thats not cool I hope you find someone new
20012,lonely,This is true
20013,lonely,yeah me too thank you for that  i feel a whole lot better now after time passed  time for the most all heals all 
20033,lonely,how come i thought new jobs were supposed to be exciting
20034,lonely,we are all the new kid for a moment soon it will feel like you fit right in just give yourself some time
20035,lonely,The job is but I am feeling a bit isolated since I dont know anyone there yet
20093,lonely,I can imagine  I hate being out alone at those kinds of hours  I try to avoid it
20094,lonely,I get that feeling  Something about the dark just feels so depressing sometimes
20095,lonely,Yeah it wouldnt be so bad if I was with someone but you know how it is When the lights are out and no one is around you feel lonely
20133,sad,That is so depressing They say dogs are mans best friend 
20134,sad,I am sure grieving can always take time It is so hard to lose such a faithful companion
20135,sad,He was definitely mine its going to take a bit to get over him
20261,lonely,ohhh I feel you I also moved to a new town last week
20262,lonely,work my boss sent me here against my will
20263,lonely,Oh wow What was your reason
20293,sad,Aw That was probably devastating
20294,sad,I hope so too
20295,sad,I treid to keep in touch but we drifted away  I hope he is happy in his life though
20439,sad,were you able to find them somewhere else
20440,sad,time to find something else
20441,sad,I think this other place carries it but theyre pretty far
20511,lonely,Have you gone out to try to meet people yet  are you happy about our job
20512,lonely,Yes i understand its rough  some people just take time to warm up  But im willing to bet you will meet someone really cool soon enough
20513,lonely,Yes I went to a local coffee shop where they were showing a band and tried to mingle but people were very closed off  I know it takes time so I guess Ill have to be happy with just me myself and I ha ha  I havent started it yet so I hope so
20535,lonely,Thats understandable what did you do to pass the time
20536,lonely,What kind of stuff did you watch
20537,lonely,i just watch stuff on roku
20621,lonely,That does sound tough did it go well at least
20622,lonely,Thats good at least you have something fun to look forward to now
20623,lonely,It went fine  Work conferences are always pretty boring but I survived  Going on vacation with the family next month so I have that to look forward to

20671,sad,Theres still some time left to make the most of it isnt there

20704,lonely,I cant even enjoy it I dont like being by meself so long
20705,lonely,I cant wait til they come back Im weird lol
20713,lonely,That sounds horribly boring You can always take this time to do some house work that you put off so that it will be ready when your friends get back in town
20714,lonely,Youre welcome Im sure youll make it  they will be back soon You could also always watch some Netflix
20715,lonely,Thanks for the advice
20795,lonely,Oh ok Is that a bad thing or do you enjoy being single
20796,lonely,Oh yeah I know what you mean Have you tried dating
20797,lonely,Yeah it was very different last time i tried But I ended up meeting my partner through friends Youll get there
20798,lonely,I am beginning to feel alone now Thats no fun
20799,lonely,I have but never got a second date Dating is so different now
20800,lonely,I hope so I guess I shouldnt rush
20858,lonely,I know that feeling  I have a husband and a boyfriend living here and it still feels empty
20859,lonely,Maybe maybe LOL I have four dogs argh
20860,lonely,Thats really intersting Maybe you need a cat to help
20926,sad,Oh man I feel for you  Kids grow up so fast  Do you feel prepared for it
20927,sad,I hear you  I have a 8 year old daughter and it feels like she was born yesterday  
20928,sad,I dont She is a young woman now and its too much for me lol
20929,sad,I am going to cry now lol
20943,sad,I am sorry I guess some friends just argue like that
20944,sad,I am sure you guys will make up
20945,sad,Yeah which is fine if we were just friends but were significant others and we plan to get married so its kind of worrisome that after years being together that were not better at communicating or at least working through an argument Its hard for us to put aside our personal feelings and be objective but only when its with one another for some reason
20959,sad,oh dear That sounds lonely How are you holding up
20960,sad,I can imagine But youll make new connections there Im sure
20961,sad,Im doing okay It was for a good reason his new job is so much better But it can get lonely
20962,lonely,I know how you feel  I moved about 3 hours away from my hometown for school and stayed for 3 years and hated it  I moved back to my hometown and am so happy now  Im sorry youre having a tough time  Have you gotten out and tried to meet people
20963,lonely,I would go with your gut  Sometimes things dont work out but you might just need more time to meet people and might want to hang in there  I hope you meet a best friend soon
20964,lonely,I have Im pretty introverted so its hard for me to meet new people Im considering a move back
20998,sad,I am sorry you have that It must be rough
20999,sad,I can only imagine
21000,sad,Thank you Yes chronic illness can be really hard  I try to stay positive because I know it makes a different on my health to stay optimistic  But this flare came suddenly and its horrible to be back in bed
21010,lonely,Sometimes that can be a good thing Its not always so bad
21011,lonely,Maybe next weekend will be better for you
21012,lonely,I guess I got through it
21075,lonely,Your youthful vigor You think youre too old now Youre only too old if you allow yourself to be My girlfriends 90yearold grandfather was a fulloflife WWII vet who lit up the room when he came in Of course youre not as physically active but you have to learn to utilize your life in different ways
21076,lonely,Well maybe its an opportunity for introspection For you to take time out of your day to think about what you need and want and what are the best ways to achieve that Maybe you need a better diet or sleep schedule or meditation or an exercise routine Sometimes you have to spend energy to feel energized Its a slow process in the beginning but it can be lifechanging
21077,lonely,Yeah I just dont have the energy I need to do things I want to 
21090,lonely,Im so glad you got to visit with them  I know how you feel to be far from family and home alone  Take heart that you are loved by your family and friends even when they arent around
21091,lonely,I can see why its even harder on you when they leave  Thats wonderful that they are such a part of your life  Take care and get out with friends soon to brighten your spirits
21092,lonely,Yeah thats true Absence makes the heart grow fonderthats the truest statement ever spoken Im one of the lucky ones who has good parents that I wish I could be around all the time Theyre funny they dont nag theyre supportive and encouraging and always insightful
21201,lonely,That sounds lonely Maybe you should try to hang out with some of your classmates
21202,lonely,I hear you At least it is only for a month Maybe you can make some weekend trips to do fun things
21203,lonely,They are all a lot older than me  I would feel out of place  I just wish there was someone my age I could hang out with
21216,sad,whats wrong with your cat
21217,sad,im sorry to hear that she will be in peace soon enough
21218,sad,She is very old We are probably going to have to put her down this week
21225,sad,Im so sorry to hear that What happened
21226,sad,I would be heartbroken as well You know you can always talk to me if you need to
21227,sad,He was climbing in his cage and fell down and bopped his head on his water feeder Knocked him right out Im going to cry again 
21228,sad,Oh no why are all the pets dying It is so sad when that happens
21229,sad,I bet you will miss your feline friend Hopefully they are in a better place now
21230,sad,I have no idea why its happening all at once but I had that cat for a good long while He was such a great cat
21231,sad,I sure do hope so too I bet theyre best buds just playin around in the afterlife
21242,lonely,Thats great How does that make you feel
21243,lonely,You should go out and meet friends Go out and do hobbies that you like I bet youll meet some new friends Are you in a big city
21244,lonely,I dont know anyone here and theres nothing to do
21249,lonely,Oh Im sorry to hear that Sometimes when you give up someone good comes along
21250,lonely,Maybe you can get a pet to distract you It could even help socialize like if you get a dog and go to a dog park
21251,lonely,Well unless it falls on my lap I will be by myself for the time being Guess I better get used to me myself and I
21360,sad,So sorry to hear that What happened Is it something serious
21361,sad,I hope the surgery went successfully and with no hassle I had a friend who went through the same thing Wish you all the best
21362,sad,It was weird and out of the blue I developed appendicitis and diverticulitis at the same time My bowels tried to kill me Just very painful mostly and I had surgery
21363,sad,I appreciate that Everything was finethey just removed my appendix and literally scrubber my intestines clean but I made it out alright
21364,lonely,Hey bro or sisyou are talking to me nowhope it helps some

21878,sad,I dont think so I am really torn up about it
21885,lonely,what have you tried doing to meet new people

22761,lonely,Yes and Yes They need help I am not their punching bag 
22811,sad,Im sorry  It sounds like you had a tough life
22812,sad,I could not have said it better myself
22813,sad,Oh I have I always maintained my glass half full though as so many have it worse But it does get harder as the years go on Life really doesnt always turn out how you think it will or how you want Its a series of unfortunate and traumatic events a lot
22829,sad,Sadly I agree with you  As I get older it seems like that more and more  What happened that made you feel that way
22830,sad,Its so true I battle chronic illness and excruciating pain daily for almost 14 years now not to mention drowning in old medical bills  I put my faith in God and pray for relief  Its really hard to stay optimistic  I really hope life improves for you and you can enjoy and embrace life again  
22831,sad,That is exactly what Ive been going through along with horrible doctors that did nothing for me  I just went high nutrient vegan 3 months ago and am improving my leaps and bounds  I follow Dr Joel Furhman  You can keep going and your journey is giving you compassion for others that are going through horrible things  Take heart and I hope you feel better  
22832,sad,Oh so many things Lots of trauma Life really is just full of lots of really difficult eventstrying to maintain your spirit and being a good person through it is really the task of life
22833,sad,Thank you I have triedits been a VERY traumatic year in so many waysand I didnt think it could get any worse a few years agoWrong I hear you with pain Please try every treatment you can DIET plays a HUGE role also chiropractor Nuerofeedback Different herbs I found eating right exercising herbs vitamins organic food helped with my pain caused by doctors I had tons of neuropathy pain and fibro like symptoms in addition to the trauma of deaths abuse etc I hope YOU feel better and YOU inspire me right now that I dont have it so bad
22834,sad,THANK YOU That sounds GREAT yes the raw groups on FB have good diets too I need to do vegan as well Just cant afford it yet Doing Fasting with Keto WOW That is true I just feel tapped out after so much abuse and traumaand losing pets and childrenJust too much trauma in a short time but I am still here I am trying to get better its just a long hard journey LOVE to you Stay strong and kind like you are So inspiring
22866,lonely,Oh what caused them to move out  Is that a good thing or a bad thing
22867,lonely,I see Im sorry youre home alone  I get lonely myself when youre used to someone around  Are you going to advertise for a new roommate
22868,lonely,He got a new job that was in a different city It isnt good or bad
22940,lonely,Aw Im sorry  Why are you lonely
22941,lonely,Maybe you could invite a friend over for a movie
22942,lonely,Maybe you could facetime your wife
22943,lonely,My wife went out of town for work for a week and Im not used to having the place to myself
22944,lonely,I could but they all have lives now
22993,lonely,Yes all the time My girlfriend always thinks Im so weird
22994,lonely,Im sorry to hear that We all have our demons Sometimes its good to take one day at a time and try to stay positive 
22995,lonely,Aw lol Well that doesnt sound good at all We are all weird in one way or another I have went through a lot of trauma though and  Its hard when you feel disconnected to everything like that
23021,lonely,Oh no  Its always tough in relationships but when you cant go see her or make her talk to you afterwards Im sure its extra hard  Did you call back and tell her that
23022,lonely,Im sure once she calms down she will look on it as not as big of a deal  If you have to work you have to work  I hope you can work it out  
23023,lonely,I didnt Its late at night and shes already tired She had a hard day at work and she was telling me about it I wasnt offering detailed responses because they were about very specific things that I couldnt necessarily give a lot of insight to So I was just trying to be broadly supportive She heard me clicking on something in the background so she flipped and thought I wasnt paying attention at all
23030,sad,I understand  Tell me about it
23031,sad,Yes one day at a time
23032,sad,IKR You have to make the best out of lemons but that is hard sometimes
23049,lonely,That sounds stressful How far did you move
23050,lonely,Thats quite a ways Do you have any hobbies that could help you meet new people
23051,lonely,Well its in another state About 5000 miles I feel far from home
23058,lonely,Yeah I do Im in a long distance relationship I get that everytime I have to fly back home I hope you start to feel better though Loneliness can end up being a good motivator however
23059,lonely,Ah your situation sounds complicated Im sorry you have to deal with that It sounds like youve given a lot of thought though and the way you lay it out you sound very mature about it Youve developed a good perspective on it one that I should learn to appreciate myself With your temperament Im sure you wont suffer from loneliness very long People will want to be around you as long as you want them around you
23060,lonely,You sound like youve dealt with more hardship than the average person I wish I could empathize with you but Ive been lucky to avoid that kind of thing recently But I do hope things will turn out differently for you soon If anything these things will make you more resilient than the average person too Thats not worth nothing
23061,lonely,Somewhat long distance here I guess Someone is away at therapy of sortsAs I cant continue to live with them with their deep rooted problemsI have to remember the bad things that I lived with so I can make that feeling stopthen I dont feel as lonely
23062,lonely,I dont really LOL I have been through a lot of trauma the past year and I only like people around I trust no drama Which is very few As you get olderyou realize you just want peace and people you love and who love you around Thats it We can die at ANY minuteand I have lost MANY this past yearIt makes you realize how short life is Thank you for your kind words Its always good to see other perspectives that help us feel appreciative of what we have  Being grateful is the key to a happy life Thanks for your kind words again
23075,sad,That sucks how old was the goldfish
23076,sad,What did you do with Goldie after she died
23077,sad,Goldie was almost a year old She was slowly swimming less and less so it wasnt completely unexpected
23087,lonely,Yes I do hate being all alone Thats how I feel when my boyfriend leaves town for work
23088,lonely,Yes you have to do what is best for yourself Take care of you before others
23089,lonely, Long distance is hard too I just have to remember for myself that it is better to be at peace then to deal with horrible drama
23156,lonely,That sounds exciting When are you going
23157,lonely,Its good to focus but surely you can take a few hours to take in the culture  China has a long and interesting history
23158,lonely,In 2 weeks Im excited to see China but gotta focus on work
23174,sad,Oh i am so sorry to hear that my friend I understand your feelings Have you thought about getting a new pet
23175,sad,I feel you When my pet dunken passed away i got a new dog named him dunken and restarted our relationship from there
23176,sad,Well I want to but I am afraid I will still miss Gary We had such a great time together
23189,sad,Not sure what an emu is I hope you find himher
23190,sad,Maybe she just wanted to go play I hope she comes back
23191,sad,Me too She was such a darling bird Im not sure why she would run away so swiftly
23247,lonely,You cannot enjoy bowling all alone It is a group game Dont you have any friends to invite
23248,lonely,What happened Is it something because of you or him
23249,lonely,Naw my friends ditched me last night It was a horrible night

23370,sad,You only have one mother you should love her no matter what
23371,sad,Eh its okay She was always a terrible person to me anyway but I did feel somewhat sad because thats what society tells us to feel
23397,sad,I feel sorry for him too although I dont know what for Can you refresh my memory
23398,sad,Ah yes I remember now That mother deserves to be hanged
23399,sad,Her mother beaten up severely Thats why she cried that much

23530,lonely,I like to also Thats why I am always disappointed
23531,lonely,thats very true  I guess i just like to believe life is like a movie
23695,sad,I could not even imagine how you would have felt
23696,sad,I do not like to be sad
23697,sad,It was awful I was sad for weeks because of it
23745,lonely,Aw  How come

23857,lonely,It probably isnt I really hope it isnt too
23858,lonely,I dont know if its depression or something else

23860,sad,Hopefully your friends make it up to you
23861,sad,Nobody even remembered I was sitting there all by myself  I still had fun though I guess

24016,lonely,yea but im introverted so its hard
24029,lonely,Did you start to feel a bit lonely
24030,lonely,Thats tough but it helps you learn what you like to do on your own
24031,lonely,Without a doubt I was the only one in the house half the time
24044,sad,Its important to spend time with your friends while you can
24045,sad,Make some good memories and enjoy these next few weeks

24516,lonely,That would have been nice
24558,sad,Oh man Im so sorry for your loss Im sure as time goes on it will become less and less
24559,sad,I can only imagine
24560,sad,Thats what they say but it just feels the opposite as you accomplish things in life and just really want to share it with your parents Thanks tho you are kind 
24561,sad,I hate to hear that did you have many memories of playing in those woods
24562,sad,Well it would have upset me as well 
24563,sad,I did which is one of the reasons it made me so sad to hear
24582,sad,What show is it
24583,sad,Ah I have heard they are brutal with the killings in that show
24584,sad,The Walking Dead It was bound to happen afterall Didnt make it any less painful

24830,sad,I love DR Pepper Its just so hard for me to keep the weight down if I continue to drink it
24831,sad,I try to keep it in moderation now but even that is hard Its so addicting
24832,sad,I was told the same thing but I am addicted I get depressed when i run out
24833,sad,I am doomed lol
24841,sad,time heals all pain
24842,sad,which is understandable
24843,sad,That is true in a way it is just very slow
24844,sad,I get that he was a very funny fellow sad story
24845,sad,I did not really so I see how you would be more attached
24846,sad,i grew up watchim him
24935,sad,That sucks  I hate when friends move away  Are you really good friends with them
24936,sad,At least shes moving for a good reason  I had a similar thing with a childhood friend who moved for school
24937,sad,Best friends for 10 years Her husband got a good job so Im happy for her
24971,sad,I was devastated as well he brought joy to all
24972,sad,Oh wow what was that like
24973,sad,i grew up with him
25020,sad,What were some of your favorites
25021,sad,I see hopefully someone can fulfill his role
25022,sad,too much to name
25106,sad,Im really sorry to hear that How long ago was that
25107,sad,Oh wow I didnt know about it Are you doing alright
25108,sad,Just last week
25141,sad,They do grow up quickly dont they But just think of all the wonderful new things hell learn and friends hell make Hell be able to tell you all about it when he gets home
25142,sad,Thats a definite plus Youll be able to have a little me time which is also important
25143,sad,Thats great on both counts You must be so proud of them both
25144,sad,Ha I remember when my nephew was born I visited my sisterinlaw at the hospital Hes 21 now
25145,sad,Yes and Ill get a break during the day also
25146,sad,Oh most definitely My daughter also got accepted into Head Start so it will be just me and my work
25147,sad,Yes they are growing up fast
25205,sad,Losing a pet is a hard thing  Was the cat old or sick
25206,sad,Did you do anything special to honor it
25207,sad,He was pretty old about 15 years
25241,lonely,Thats a bummer I hope you guys can plan something together once the deadline is over 
25242,lonely,I know  just make sure you do something fun when you have a chance 
25243,lonely,Maybe but Im not sure when another opportunity like this will come It really gets me down
25253,sad,What is your favorite ice cream
25254,sad,Oh that is unfortunate maybe next time
25255,sad,I really like chocolate but I didnt make it to the store in time and they were already closed 
25259,lonely,Maybe find another adult with a kid for a play date
25260,lonely,Yeah being with other adults can help
25261,lonely,Yeah thats a pretty good idea  I can end up getting a little depressed when all I do is clean up toys all day
25262,lonely,good advice
25368,sad,Oh no I am so sorry How long do you have to wait to take it again
25369,sad,I remember struggling with that too when I did my test I was so nervous 
25370,sad,At least a week The hardest part is parallel parking where i always touch the yellow bars slightly with the back bump of the car
25371,sad,Uh oh thats bad Did you have insurance for it
25372,sad,Oh no I hope youre able to get it fixed for cheap
25373,sad,No and I was very upset
25451,lonely,It is a gorgeous day where I live too Im sorry you dont have anyone to share it with  Do you have plans later
25452,lonely,Ill be relaxing in my pool later  You shouldnt let a day go wasted just because you dont have anyone to hang with
25453,lonely,I dont We should plan something together then  Lol
25480,lonely,Are you sad and all alone now
25481,lonely,Maybe you can find a new friend
25482,lonely,Yeah I am and it sucks 
25510,sad,How old was your doggy
25511,sad,Did she have a disease
25512,sad,She was almost 8 years old Not that old really 
25513,sad,Yes she did 
25570,lonely,Aww Im sorry to hear that Maybe you can find a new hobby for the weekends
25571,lonely,I definitely understand It really sucks that youre so limited 
25572,lonely,Its hard with my 2 year old Its almost impossible to do anything
25609,lonely,Aww that must be kinda hard on you
25610,lonely,Ive definitely been there my husband is in the military so hes away often I find its helpful to stay busy trying new hobbies help
25611,lonely,Yea  Im not sure what to do by myself in that big house of ours
25675,sad,How do you mean I guess it depends on the lady does it not
25676,sad,Oh I am so sorry  that is an awful thing to happen But please dont think all women are like that many are loving and loyal
25677,sad,I just feel sad because my girl friend had relations with my best friend I am leaving her
25756,lonely,Omg congrats D
25757,lonely,Yeah at first it might feel a little lonely but itll be nice to have some relaxation time right 
25758,lonely,I dont like it yet I am really feeling this empty nest
25838,lonely,I understand that I bet you miss them a lot
25839,lonely,Yeah it is rough at that age to be apart At least you can Skype and keep in touch
25840,lonely,i do its tough because he is still a baby
25883,sad,Why would they take it off air it was a great show
25884,sad,that is not cool do you think it will ever come back
25885,sad,Jerry Seinfeld didnt want to do it anymore The show was 1 yet he didnt care
25923,lonely,i wish i could stay up late and just watch tv alone some times i dont have any alone time
25924,lonely,yup
25925,lonely,Always with the family Thats a blessing and a curse I guess
25948,sad,oh no is she alright
25949,sad,so she probably had scar tissue i hope this one goes better for her
25950,sad,she has a couple bad discs she has had the surgery before which makes it worse
25980,sad,i know the feeling it makes you wish time would slow down
25981,sad,thats right going through the same feeling with my son
25982,sad,Right or you could reverse it but I guess thats life
25983,sad,I dont have any kids but I can only imagine  It even seems like Im growing old fast
25984,sad,How old is he
25985,sad,its a great feeling and sad at the same time
25996,lonely,It must feel lonely for sure but maybe they cope with it in different ways
25997,lonely,Yeah it is quite sad knowing there are some people who have literally no one
25998,lonely,I believe everyone should be loved by someone so that they dont stay lonely
26031,sad,Yeah that is pretty tough Especially when you really like to work together
26032,sad,Then you have to meet their replacement and try to get to know them better It usually isnt the same
26033,sad,Yeah Its one of the main reasons for liking a job is the people you work with and become friends with
26046,sad,Im sorry to hear that Is it drugs or alcohol
26047,sad,Oh my I thought the wrong thing Im so sorry to hear that I hope he is okay
26048,sad,he had pneumonia and then ended up dying for 28 minutes then he is now in rehab learning how to do everything again
26049,sad,its ok hes making progress hopefully he will make a full recovery soon
26074,lonely,Wow that is very far away Do you get to visit often
26075,lonely,Yeah that is a bummer Maybe one day you will live closer together
26076,lonely,i try but money is tight
26077,lonely,i doubt it i love where i live now
26268,lonely,That must be pretty lonely Do you talk often
26269,lonely,Well that should help
26270,lonely,Well eep it up and visit when you can
26271,lonely,mostly daily or at least once a week
26272,lonely,it does a little
26273,lonely,i am trying to work on it
26320,lonely,You should find the local cafe or something
26321,lonely,You can always google the local hot spots Youve got to get out there It might not be easy
26322,lonely,Yeah I have found one Starbucks so far I guess I need to explore the area a bit more
26348,lonely,Do you feel better now
26349,lonely,Thats good Its sucks when you have to take care of yourself when you dont feel well
26350,lonely,Much much better
26355,sad,I can understand that Everything is right at your doorsteps 
26356,sad,That can be very rough Maybe you can move there soon
26357,sad,MY friends are so far away now We hardly ever see each other

27704,sad,That stinks   Im sorry its so hard for you
27705,sad,Well I hate going through anything badbut I never get to go through the process of it and get healed because I have someone who was around me during the worst times of my life who took that away from me and made the focus be on themwhich disrupted my process of grief and healing

28049,lonely,What sorts of places have you been going Alone time is always great but then sometimes it gets to be too much so I understand
28050,lonely,You could always do that but maybe exploring on your own can give you a different perspective on things

31309,sad,Oh no I am so sorry Turtles need a lot of care to thrive
31310,sad,Actually they are that is why so many die in captivityThey need proper lights and diet etcI guess if you know how to take care of animals then no but so many just dont care when they have a pet who relies on them
31311,sad,Usually theyre not too maintenence intensive
31423,sad,Oh no is she ok
31424,sad,Im so sorry Do you have a good support system
31425,sad,She passed away last year and I do not know how to cope with it
31465,sad,Oh no  I am so sorry  I have been there and its devastating  How is everyone doing
31466,sad,It will take time  Allow yourself to grieve and also doing something to remember your pet can help give closure  Take care and take a day at a time
31467,sad,We are ok but I am not sure I can recover
31518,lonely,Congratulations  What degree did you get
31519,lonely,Awesome  I bet thats a really versatile degree you should be really successful
31520,lonely,I got the one in business field
31566,sad,Im sorry to hear that have they done any tests
31567,sad,I hope everything turns out for the better
31568,sad,Shes currently going to appointments and things So theyll find out more soon 
31612,lonely,Exciting  How are you settling in  It might take a while but youll start making friends and setting up a community around you
31613,lonely,I can understand that  It is usually very isolating to move especially if its away from family and friends  I did that as well and found I had to consistently get out and try to meet people  It wasnt always a success but after about 2 months I started to have things to do  Keep your chin up and go explore your new city
31614,lonely, I have no one around me anymore so its left me a bit depressed
31621,lonely,Do you find some along time good do you like being alone every once in a while
31622,lonely,I can imagine when my daughter leaves with her friends on the weekend i miss her like crazy too
31623,lonely,I thought I would enjoy it much more than I did I just miss her like crazy
31672,sad,I certainly do  I think it shows you care and have compassion for their situations  So many people lose that compassion and even practice indifference How about you
31673,sad,I can understand that  I mean youre with them as you watch everything they go through and you start to really like them  When it ends its like was this not real  I hate coming to the end of shows that run for a long time  So sad
31674,sad,I got really upset when I watched the finale of the office  I felt like I was part of their team and when the whole thing was over I cried a little  It was like I was losing some friends
31687,sad,That is sad but maybe youll make new friends at school Is it your first year
31688,sad,Im sure itll be fine Everybody will be in the same boat I hope it goes well
31689,sad,Yeah its going to be my first year there but Im a junior technically but yeah I hope I do
31765,lonely,Im sorry to hear that How did she die
31766,lonely,Oh wow That stinks How are you holding up
31767,lonely,She was in a car accident
31771,lonely,Aw thats never fun  My husband used to travel all the time for work and it was so lonely  Im glad she wont be gone too long  I took advantage of the times he was gone to clean and organize and fix things to surprise him when he returned
31772,lonely,Wow youre on top of things Being apart does make the heart grow fonder  Make or carry out her a romantic dinner when she gets back Go out with a friend while shes gone
31773,lonely,Yeah this first week was pretty productive actually I fixed a few things around the house and then just relaxed But now the fun is over and my emotions are getting to me But hey not long left to wait
31811,lonely,That sucks but im glad youre enjoying your self still
31812,lonely,I think thats a good idea Look at it as an opportunity to make new friends
31813,lonely,yeah guess Im getting to relax more and I did decide to go out tomorrow night to meet some people Well see how it goes
31902,lonely,Why do you feel that way
31903,lonely,That does sound hard
31904,lonely,My wife is an ICU nurse who works night shift  So i am usually home alone 
31935,lonely,Do you like your new city
31936,lonely,How do your friends feel about the situation
31937,lonely,Yea it seems nice and my job pays well I really wish I had my friends to check out the city with
31947,sad,Im sorry to hear that Is he going to the doctor for help
31948,sad,Oh wow it sounds like he is doing great I hope he feels better soon
31949,sad,he spent two months in the hospital and is almost a month in to his rehab
31950,sad,hes got about 18 days still covered by his insurance hopefully hes ready when its time to go home
32081,sad,I know what you mean hope it gets better
32082,sad,I get that here is to hoping it shows up soon
32083,sad,I do too I miss the sun
32112,sad,I bet they will miss you not being there
32113,sad,You will have time again
32114,sad,Yes I think so Almost as much as I miss not being there lol
32159,lonely,Why didnt you make any plans before the weekend started
32160,lonely,Well I hope you feel better and get some rest Maybe next weekend will be better for you

32245,sad,Well they made up for it last year
32246,sad,Oh yeah I forgot about that ha
32247,sad,That is for sure it was awesome to do it against the team that made me cry as a kid priceless
32304,lonely,Ah maybe it will look up for you She could still call
32305,lonely,Well even if she doesnt you could always be straightforward with her and just ask her if shes not into you then let you know so you can move on
32306,lonely,I guess so I am not positive about it though
32310,lonely,Ok if thats what you decide to do I believe you have had time to think it through 
32311,lonely,Ok the most important thing is that you have a source that pays for the bills
32312,lonely,I dont have a choice It is the only job that I found
32330,sad,Aww Im sorry to hear that I hope she went to a good home 
32331,sad,Thats good to hear Im sure you miss her a lot
32332,sad,She did for sure
32388,lonely,I am glad you got out of it
32389,lonely,That is very true
32390,lonely,Me too thank you things always get better
32494,sad,Sorry to hear that what do you do to try and stay enlighten and happy when thinking of them
32495,sad,I know it may be hard but they are always close to you when thinking of them through your memories and the good times
32496,sad,I just have memories I guess
32530,lonely,Thats great I assume she did well then
32531,lonely,Thats amazing I can see why you are proud 
32532,lonely,She scored advanced in all categories
32584,lonely,What happened
32585,lonely,I can understand that you cannot be a doormat though ever
32586,lonely,Oh its kind of private but someone who just doesnt treat me right and they cant live here anymore Its hard to not be an enabler when you love the person but I wont be a doormat anymore
32654,sad,That is too bad is he okay
32655,sad,Well that isnt good you should go see him
32656,sad,Hes been isolated himself from everyone
32667,lonely,Oh no Where did the kids go

34538,lonely,Im not sure She was very old I had her so long 
34573,lonely,I can understand that Its usually either parents are happy they are out of the house or sad that theyre gone Im sorry you feel lonely 
34574,lonely,I can understand that Kids have a big presence and their energy creates a void Hopefully you can find things to take your mind off of it 
34575,lonely,Yes it is My youngest has been away all this week for his first summer camp Its been both awesome and lonely 
34576,lonely,Most of the time Im happy and content but occasionally I get lonely
34577,lonely,Its weird how they can drive you crazy when they are with you but you miss them the minute they are gone
34578,lonely,They finally go back to school next week and Im looking forward to it but I know Ill get lonely at times
34589,sad,Oh no When I misplace things I try to retrace my steps Have you tried that

34591,sad,I did but it seems to have vanished completely Its quite strangeand I do wonder if my cat had something to do with it
34624,lonely,Oh no Thats a tough change but I suppose youll have to try to join clubs and make new ones
34625,lonely,Its harder as an adult but you can make some by joining some adult clubs that focus on sports or recreation Or if you have a neighborhood club joining that
34626,lonely,Yes but I dont know where to find new friends
34743,sad,Im sorry to hear that Have you had your cat a long time

35182,lonely,Im jealous of you Ive had a roommate the past few years since Im in college First one I had battle depression and mental illness and even checked himself into a behavioral center because he was feeling suicidal This recent roommate seems normal enough though
35183,lonely,Im glad to hear it At least you know youre good at being social in some ways Maybe you can make friends outside of roommates and then be able to be social outside of your apartment and be able to come home and have the peace and quiet
35184,lonely,But we got along really well He had to move away Now I have no one to hang out with while I am at home

35276,sad,I hope so too its a difficult time for sure
35288,sad,Yea that is really far Give it some time and I am sure you will meet some new people
35289,sad,It takes time to adapt to a new city Get involved in some groups to meet like minded people
35290,sad,Thanks for that Ive been feeling pretty blue so I appreciate it
35306,sad,Oh no  How old was he
35307,sad,What type of dog was he
35308,sad,I had him for 12 years 
35315,sad,That is just the worst who made fun of you
35316,sad,Thats so disappointing People should really not be judging others when they dont know how much effort was put in to the outfit
35317,sad,Hi are you still here
35318,sad,It did what were we talking about again
35319,sad,It was actually a stranger and I was on public transportation They didnt actually say anything to me I could just tell the way they were giving me a look and kind of shaking their head and then laughing to themselves that it was pointed at me Maybe I read too much into it Either way made me want to sink into the ground
35320,sad,I think it was my haircut  But thank you for the kind words I need you to hype me up in the morning and make me feel confident
35321,sad,Yes it seemed to bug out not sure
35322,sad,I can understand that I lost my dog a few years ago Whats worse is I wasnt around when it happenedI was out of the state I hope you at least got to say goodbye
35323,sad,Man Im so sorry I remember when I was really young I was in the car with my mom and she hit our neighbors cat driving home They just ran right out into the street She drove home and cried for a while
35324,sad,Who knows They could have been like my mom and maybe they were different and were too ashamed to say anything Might not have noticed either Or they were just bad people Hopefully you can focus on your pet and how much you loved them instead of those things you cant get answers to
35325,sad,It was the worst I didnt get to say goodbye she got hit by a car
35326,sad,It was so difficult I dont even know if the person cares that they took away my favorite pet
35353,sad,OH no Did you study
35354,sad,LOL English is a tough subject
35355,sad,A little I mean it was an English test I know English LOL
35439,lonely,Ah so are you feeling pretty lonely Thats interesting that he took the dog with him on a business trip but who am I to judge Could be viewed as kind of cool that hes that close with the dog
35440,lonely,Yeah he should have left the dog with you so not only would you have some company but some protection too But I dont know all of the situation so I guess I shouldnt say for sure Hopefully its not for too long so you guys can get back to being a trio
35441,lonely,Yeah were both kind of crazy about the dog lol and I hate being alone in the house
35487,sad,Oh thats terrible If you dont mind me asking
35488,sad,Maybe he is trying to do what he thinks is best Im sure its out of love not just being mean
35489,sad,My stepdad wont let me play baseball anymore simply because I hurt my arm throwing
35490,sad,I think so too maybe I could play some hockey instead
35550,sad,What Are you sick or your family member
35551,sad,Oh no Im so sorry to hear that it must have been hard on you
35552,sad,It was my father who was sick He passed not too long ago
35565,lonely,Aw was she stressed out
35566,lonely,Aw thats no fun I bet the constant construction didnt help at all
35567,lonely,Just a little since she was around other cats for the first time I think I was more of a wreck than she was though  The house seemed so empty without her
35568,lonely,I slept through it all when I could or went to visit my little brat
35569,sad,Oh wow  My dog passed away recently too so I can relate to your pain  I am so sorry for your loss
35570,sad,Most definetly she was my constant companion  It will hopefully get easier for us each day
35571,sad,Thanks and to you too They really are our best friends 
35572,sad,Agreed I will probably consider a rescue dog my second dog is lonely now 
35621,sad,Thats no good how did you break it
35622,sad,no good are you going to get another one
35623,sad,Id buy it off you after its fixed I love tag heuer

35626,sad,Its a tag heuer  Im gonna get it fixed
35627,sad,It was my grandfathers watch I dont think you have enough money to cover its sentimental value
35667,lonely,Well that was absolutely terrible He certainly picked the worse time to do it Youre right he was a jerk
35668,lonely,Oh well Im sorry that is definitely an unpleasant Valentines day But on the positive side at least you found out what a jerk he was before you became more committed 
35669,lonely,I know right So instead of going out to the fancy restaurant Id booked for us I spent the night on the couch watching Friends reruns Alone
35689,sad,Oh that must be hard  Are you guys really close
35690,sad,Man I know how that feels  When I go to visit my sister and nieces I have such a hard time when its time to fly home
35691,sad,We are and its painful to see her go because I know I wont see her again until next year
35712,lonely,That sucks Did she say why
35713,lonely,Wow thats harsh
35714,lonely,Find a new girlfriend  That ship has sailed   If youre really still want her consider trying to play the jealousy card  ie
35715,lonely,You dont even have to do that Keep it classy Just show up with a pretty girl and have a good time and be a perfect gentleman  Dont even bat an eye at her
35716,lonely,She wanted to try something new she was bored of me
35717,lonely,It is I dont know what to do anymore any ideas
35718,lonely,Im gonna do that thank you for the advice I could try to kiss someone else to make her mad
35741,lonely,Im sorry to hear that  How are you going
35742,lonely,Thats true  Just remember that as much as it might sting now there are plenty of people out there and you want to find one that makes you happy all of the time not just some of the time
35743,lonely,Doing ok i guess  Probably better its over now rather than later
35744,sad,Man that is really hard  I can relate however bc my sweet Rileydog just had to be put to sleep due to congestive heart failure
35745,sad,It doesnt  Try hard to stay positive and remember he isnt suffering anymore
35746,sad,Yeah I understand it was his time to go but it doesnt make it any easier
35801,sad,Sorry to hear that
35802,sad,What happened

35953,lonely,Is there anything else you do besides work A hobby you enjoy video games music working out
35954,lonely,Healing is never easy It always has the negatives Any sort of healing always starts with pain a open wound and itchy scabs and the left over scar I wish I could talk to you daily and help you get through it I know its hard to go and do things alone I recently discovered a text number that allows you to talk to someone when you are feeling down it is 741741 I have used it just recently myself It does work and is better then nothing 
35955,lonely,That is hard as there is not the typical work which keeps me busy on the weekdays
35956,lonely,Look for work work on business and try not to let it get to me
35957,lonely,I workout daily I try to keep busy but the loneliness eats at me right now I just had to kick my partner out to go get helpI miss himbut I dont miss the bad partsbut its still hard to be alone and do everything alone you know I am not at a music place yet I am healing as well Healing is NOT easy
36026,lonely,Not at all It is kind of boring being left to clean everything alone
36027,lonely,And you might get called a weirdo Haha
36028,lonely,It is Its sort of like how if someone packs you a little note with your lunch its really nice but obviously if you made your own note youd just feel silly
36058,lonely,That is sad Do you have other children
36059,lonely,I understand Anyway he will keep visiting

41777,sad,That is very irresponsible from your side It is never wise to spend your hard earned money on such leisure
41778,sad,That is the illusion of winning when in reality you are expected to lose
41779,sad,I thought i was going to win double the amount
41787,sad,Oh no when did this happen Do you think youll find him

42244,lonely,Sounds like a plan
42245,lonely,I should maybe Ill go down to the local pub I need to get some fresh air

42282,lonely,Ok why would you do that

42314,sad,Aww shoot I lost a dog when i was little in a very tragic way as well I miss that big guy he was like a brother to me Hope youre doing good now hes in a good place
42315,sad,It was actually rather tragic but Ill spare you the details He had a good life though He was my dads son lol

42432,sad,I dont know much about cryptocurrency at all  You were brave to invest in a new thing but Im sorry that you lost money
42433,sad,Maybe you can find a new investment that will give great returns and you can recoup what you lost
42434,sad,Ive learned my lesson I need to do a little more research from now on
42435,sad,Im thinking about playing around with actual stocks from now on
42436,lonely,Are you feeling more lonely than you expected
42437,lonely,I get that way too when my kids are away for too long Its good to find someone to hang out with to keep yourself occupied
42438,lonely,Well my girls went on a mission trip this summer and the house was way too quiet during the day it was too much alone time I think
42439,lonely,Its called the hour of the wolf 
42440,lonely,Yes look it up its quite interesting
42441,lonely,Whoa seriously
42442,lonely,Is that where the expression lone wolf comes from
42455,sad,Yes Im a picky eater
42456,sad,Yes I hate that I usually end up going back and getting some more just for me
42457,sad,You ever have the situation where somebody buys doughnuts for your group and somebody else eats the last one of the only flavor you like
42458,sad,True this
42474,sad,That is so sad I know how it feels to lose a pet
42475,sad,I lost a goldfish once She was my best friend

42501,sad,Headed to Mystic CT for his job I am not at all excited about leaving my friends and family I hope it wont be as bad as I feel that it will be
42531,sad,Im so sorry to hear that my girlfriends cat is going through the same thing right now It cant be easy
42532,sad,Thats so sad The best thing you can do is spend lots of time with her and make every minute count I wish you all the best
42533,sad,I think next week we will have to put her down
42534,lonely,Usually people want someone in their life I guess that takes staying away from others
42535,lonely,Some people prefer to be alone Whatever makes them happy I suppose
42536,lonely,I think maybe their lifestyle make them not to have space for others
42630,lonely,Im not quite sure I understand did you go bowling by yourself If so thats so sad and lonesome
42631,lonely,As someone who deals with lonesome moments I know how that feels I wouldve totally gone with you had I known you haha
42632,lonely,Yeah I went to the bowling alley all by myself sorry forgot a word It was so lonely
42639,sad,That is a real bummer Maybe you should take some time to reflect on their life
42640,sad,Yeah no need to talk to me about it right now Think about all the good times you had together
42641,sad,I think you are right I am so upset that I am afraid that I am going to electrocute myself with all the tears splashing on my keyboard
42710,sad,Thats too bad Did someone cut you off
42711,sad,Awww I would be sad too Did anyone go and get it
42712,sad,I saw a dead dog on the side of the road  It was not a good sight to see  I felt bad that it was someones pet
42793,sad,Oh thats so aggravating my dog still has accidents but not many
42794,sad,Thats terrible but the rug is replaceable 
42795,sad,Yeah she doesnt do it often but she ruined the rug I was so sad
42835,sad,Oh Im so sorry to hear that How long did you have your rabbit for
42836,sad,I could imagine I dont have any pets But I understand it can be really devastating
42837,sad,A few years We were pretty close
42866,lonely,Thats so sad Maybe you should give him a call
42867,lonely,Thats the spirit The loneliness should melt away
42868,lonely,Thats a good idea Hes going to be gone for a week Im going to have to call him
42875,sad,That really sucks What kind of car was it
42876,sad,Ah I used to have one of those Those cars were built to last
42877,sad,It was an old Grand Prix  I had it for years and it am very emotionally attached to it
42893,sad,That is terrible I am so sorry Was it of natural causes
42894,sad,You can just replace him that fast Dont you need time
42895,sad,Yeah I think so I am really not sure since he hasnt been to a vet in a while I may go get a new one in a bit
42908,lonely,Did you try to find someone to go with
42909,lonely,Maybe you should find some new friends
42910,lonely,I did  but my friends ditched me Some friends they are
42911,sad,Mine did too  5 minutes ago actually Are you thinking about getting a new one
42912,sad,Thats too bad Perhaps it would help you heal your troubles away
42913,sad,No I dont think I will get another one
42972,sad,Thats a bummer Did you at least go get it resolved at the bank
42973,sad,Thats quite unfortunate then Gotta be more careful with that
42974,sad,I talked to them but they werent willing to waive the fee
42991,sad,where did it go
42992,sad,I hope so hope is still alive and Have you search everywhere
42993,sad,Im not sure Shes probably around the neighborhood somewhere but I havent found her yet I hope shes ok
43011,sad,What are they repeating
43012,sad,I hope you can provide them with some help
43013,sad,Bad behaviors and attitudes Its hard to see they keep going back to the same path
43014,sad,Well therapy will I hope Thank you
43039,sad,why did your friendship with your friend ended
43040,sad,that is true i agree with you that is not what friends do
43041,sad,People talked about impeaching me and she agreed A best friend should have talked to me about it instead of joining the crowd of haters
43045,lonely,You sound lonely Do you not have any friends
43046,lonely,Have you considered joining any hobby groups to make some new friends
43047,lonely,no i dont

43114,lonely,Im glad the bad times have stopped and hope your furkids can help cheer you up I feel lonely at times too its only human
43115,lonely,No my partner isnt here anymore I live aloneexcept for furkids  But everytime I felt that wayI remembered the bad times and I didnt feel so bad about living alone

45632,sad,I was really busy with work and she was only in town for a couple of dayS

45742,lonely,Well I hope you do find that special someone and that the stress at work lets up a bit as well
45743,lonely,I am not a believer in therapy sessions They have temporary effects but cost much The only solution is get into relationship I hope to find that someone special

46422,sad,Oh that is just awful Losing someone is so hard 
46423,sad,Was he ill or was it sudden Either way its still painful 
46424,sad,i could not believe it
46487,lonely,Glad to hear your life took a turn Its always weird and even sometimes funny to look back on your life to see where you came from and how different and sometimes worse things were
46488,lonely,Well its always so annoying in the beginning when you know you have to change but to see how much work there is to do in order to reach that change Its hard for people to break things up into smaller pieces so its not so daunting But congratulations to you for reaching a happier place
46489,lonely,That is for sure it was not in a great place but with some hard work you can always improve
46497,lonely,Did they go away or did you break up
46498,lonely,Well remember that he is doing something healthy for himself and that should make your relationship stronger in the end
46499,lonely,No not really break up He is away getting help and he needs it so I have to tough it out
46500,lonely,I do it is hard but that is why I am willing to do through it
46510,lonely,Ah Im sorry to hear that Were you really busy today then
46511,lonely,Oh yeah I know it I have to work remote sometimes and depending on the mood loneliness hits hard

46648,lonely,Yeah but a lot of them wont come back Once they graduate theyll move off and start their lives
46649,lonely,That could be an option but Ill miss my actual friends a lot
46693,sad,Man that has to be a rough go
46694,sad,Sometimes they enjoy being able to get around on their own even if it is dangerous
46695,sad,He was very old I felt bad for him that he didnt have any family to help he almost got hit a few times I meanmaybe he is happy But I just felt bad 
46696,sad,true I would love that I just felt bad he didnt have any family I have lost a lot of people too and it would be hard to be all alone
46756,lonely,How terrible Im so sorry that happened How long ago was it
46757,lonely,Have you tried to find a counselor That might help you to get through it
46758,lonely,2 weeks ago I dont even have anyone to talk to Its the worst
46781,lonely,did you say something or show up anyway
46782,lonely,i guess thats true
46783,lonely,Well I thought about saying something but I feel like you cant force a friendship
46818,sad,Thats not good Take them away start early
46819,sad,No you dont have too Little kids can just play with toys and not on video games Its not good for them really
46820,sad,I have to He like to have my phone and the ipad playing the same video
46821,sad,I dont want him not wanting to play physically when he is older
46841,lonely,I cant imagine I have a hard time sitting for long hours too What are you looking in too
46842,lonely,Thats a job that is needed for sure You could also try and get a degree in programming it usually only takes a year So many things you can do Also look into selling online Its a great business if you stay on top of it daily 
46843,lonely,Thats the tricky part I dont really know I dont have a good college education or anything and truck driving pays well its just not healthy for my current lifestyle My cousin does heating and cooling and offered to help me there so I think Ill take him up on that
46920,lonely,Did you travel for work or for vacation
46921,lonely,Its too soon to be homesick
46922,lonely,I am on vacation The hostel I checked into is really empty right now so I have been thinking of home a lot
46938,lonely,Your company left you alone In what way That does sound like a troubling situation
46939,lonely,Oh I see That makes a little more sense Did everything work out or are they still gone
46940,lonely,They had to leave on an emergency and so then I was all by myself
46953,lonely,I know how you feel I can be lonely sometimes 
46954,lonely,I recommend taking some time to explore the city and find an hobby or interest and join some groups It takes time to find a new set of friends
46955,lonely,It really is I dont have any family or friends around I miss them
46956,lonely,Ill do that Thanks for the advice
46970,lonely,Long trip How can you afford it
46971,lonely,Okay I get it Ever seen the movie Hostel
46972,lonely,Its really cheap in South East Asia Its low season and there arent many people in the hostel so I have been thinking of home a lot
47023,sad,I am sure it is a bittersweet moment  I can relate myself  It takes some getting used to
47024,sad,You will still have plenty of time before your son becomes an unruly teenager  Cherish it
47025,sad,I mean im happy for the up coming peace and quiet but its still sad all my kids arent babies anymore
47026,sad,Ive got a 12 year old thats getting mighty close
47039,lonely, I was late to an appointment recently because I got stuck in a traffic jam 
47040,lonely,Thats so annoying Maybe you should leave earlier next time
47041,lonely,How late were you
47048,sad,Did you talk to your boss
47049,sad,Thats awful what did you want to do
47050,sad,yea didnt matter
47077,sad,Have you asked the merchant why it is late
47078,sad,I would be too They should be more diligent with their shipping estimates
47079,sad,Yeah to no response of course I am upset about it 
47108,lonely,Probably once or twice in my life but I dont go anywhere alone so  
47109,lonely,That is really crappy i think whatever makes you feel that way you should try to figure it out and battle it You deserve to be happy all the time 
47110,lonely,I sometimes feel this way Its kinda sad
47165,lonely,Could you call people
47166,lonely,Yes meet new people
47167,lonely,Thats a great idea I should spend a little bit more time outside of the area as well
47168,lonely,Thank you for the advice Ill take you up on that
47178,sad,Im so sorry to hear that Were you able to be there when she passed
47179,sad,Sometimes you dont know when theyll pass unfortunately I hope you take some time to grive
47180,sad,I was not I am so devestated
47299,lonely,oh im so sorry you felt this way I hope your mood will get better maybe watch a good comedy
47300,lonely,i understand how you feel though i would feel lonely but i would definitely do something fun like play video games or watch movie
47301,lonely,Thats not bad advice Maybe I should do something to take my mind off things And yeah it will eventually Nobodys fault so I shouldnt be brooding
47374,lonely,You must miss her But Im sure shell be back before you know it
47375,lonely,She must like to travel Have you ever gone with her
47376,lonely,I hope so She is always going on trips
47592,lonely,That really stinks Maybe you should try and find something that your good at and do that
47593,lonely,What do you think you are really good
47594,lonely,Yeah I should really work on something Im passionate about

50385,sad,I am sorry to hear that Why didnt you get the promotion
50386,sad,It shouldnt be based off the seniority It should be based off skill and If you had the skill you should have gotten it

50664,sad,Definitely Not to make this about me but Ive had a lot of issues in my life that simply got worse over time because I kept it to myself
50665,sad,I have been too sad to tell anyone about this so I have kept it secret Do you think I should talk to someone
50672,sad, Im sorry to hear that I understand they can live a really long time Was it an old parrot

50676,sad,ive been there  But get out there and meet some new people  go get drunk and go to a party
50677,sad,I hope so right now I am just sad and have been crying in my dorm all day
50788,lonely,I know how you feel What helped me was getting a bicycle and get out in the sun for some exercise
50789,lonely,I feel you Well it sounds like you keep yourself busy with a hobby at least 
50790,lonely,I like to go outside sometimes but I try to keep my mind busy so I dont get more upset I have a partnerkind ofbut he is away getting help and everyday I just dont know everyday how it will go or how long it will take Its hard
50791,lonely,WORK is my hobby lol and business Good hobby right now 
50818,lonely,Oh no Im sorry  What went badly  One things or just lots of little things
50819,lonely,I completely get it  Hope things are better tomorrow
50820,lonely,Oh well Partner is away at therapy for Goodness knows how longand he was a bit cranky yesterday so that makes me feel even more alone I didnt hear from him for awhile today and you know how that makes you feel nervous
50821,lonely,He seems better now PHEW Lol I hate it when others emotions control your day 
50924,sad,I get that What show is it
50925,sad,I have never heard of it I did watch the movie though It would have been cool if they got Jennifer garner and Ben Afleck in it
50926,sad,I finished Daredevil I loved that show Im just glad that the Marvel shows are connected
50927,sad,Its a show on Netflix
50952,lonely,That is pretty hard my dude But join some clubs or get to know some people in your dorm area
50953,lonely,Also try joining a club you might end up in apartment with someone next year instead of the cramped dorms
50954,lonely,Yes I think I will have to do that because I dont want to feel lonely and cry in my room all day 
50982,sad,I am sorry to hear that  Unfortunately a lot of dog breeds have a high risk of cancer  Is it treatable  
50983,sad,Oh my  I have been in that situation before  You have my sympathies  
50984,sad,I guess not because the surgery didnt work so we have to put her down
50988,sad,that is not good why did you miss your sons game
50989,sad,well if it is work then it is ok because you have to put food on the table first i can relate to that
50990,sad,i wasnt able to get out of work on time due to being way too much work
51020,sad,aww im sorry thats always hard
51021,sad,I hope you are able to make some new friends  Or keep in touch with video calls
51022,sad,I am going to be so miserable
51059,sad,Thats really sad  Im sorry to hear that  Getting old stinks  I feel bad when I see someone who seems really lonely
51060,sad,Yea thats hard  You cant do anything now but maybe theres another neighbor that you can get close too 
51061,sad,I know I think she was just a widow and most of her friends had passed away or something I felt like I should have gotten closer to her but I also didnt want to intrude I dont know thats probably just a lame excuse It would have been easy enough for me to do
51109,lonely,Do they live far away from you
51110,lonely,wow that is far  I hope you guys use video chats
51111,lonely,they live 800 miles away and it makes it so hard when i miss them this much
51112,lonely,sometimes its hard because i have a ton of nieces and nephews and most of them are too young to have their own phones
51247,lonely,Its definitely not fair It seems almost as if people do not TRY to create a friendship or are playing both ends of the candle to see which bargain plans per friends are better and then make a choice
51248,lonely,Yes true friends understand and will work around your schedule and wont put you off or make you feel like you have done something wrong  
51249,lonely,Not sure how to approach it On the one hand we used to be good friends and hung out all the time in college Now after we graduated theyve grown distant I dont want to be annoying but I want to be available too you know Cause friendships are hard to maintaincreate as you get older
51263,sad,What happened to your grama

51983,sad,I know My grandmother hasnt been gone a year I dont want to lose him too just not a good day 
52041,sad,I am so sorry It happens to everyone and no one is ever prepared for it
52042,sad,Thats the only bad thing about having animals you are going to outlive them
52043,sad,Its almost like  I thought he would live with me forever He was there for most of my life
52066,lonely,Thats great  Did she move recently  Do you miss her

52528,sad,Oh no  Im so sorry we just went through that with our pup  Its a hard choice to have to make
52529,sad,Im sorry you are having to make that choice but I feel its our duty to them to help them pass on when they are not going to get better and help them not suffer any longer
52530,sad,She has been sick for a month and is not improving
52534,sad,Thats so sad What do you think about that

52537,sad,that is true
52557,lonely,Did you have fun there by yourself at least

52559,lonely,I tried too but I felt bad seeing everyone else in large groups having a blast That shouldve have been me yesterday
52567,sad,Could there be a reason that he is

52636,lonely,Thats really rough my friend I am sure there must be other folks that you can befriend Theres plenty of nice and kind people in the world
52637,lonely,Well we will definitely chat through social media or call each other But physical distance is hard to overcome Additionally I am single and do not have a partner to be with

53373,sad,I had become close to her as of late She was a very strong and respected woman
53374,sad,I think she did We got along very well and she was always happy to see me
53395,lonely,that can be tough but it also can be great to have time for yourself
53396,lonely,i can see where isolation can be overwhelming and the need for social contact is desirable and needed
53397,lonely,At first I felt that way but over a period of time it can get very overwhelming
53398,lonely,I did try to keep busy to keep it from setting in but it got to be too much sometimes Im glad that I am away from that
53740,lonely,What are you waiting for
53741,lonely,Oh I totally know how that goes I moved to small town and didnt have many friends at first Once I had my son and made more friends it got way better lol

54674,lonely,Yes about once a week sometimes more She just went off to college so she lives out of state
54754,lonely,Im sorry to hear that Maybe you can find a local club so you can meet people with similar interests

55225,lonely,That sounds difficult Did you try talking to people in your neighborhood

59419,sad,Yeah he was 8 years old I know it was probably just his time
59475,lonely,I understand sometimes it uncomfortable to socialize I get anxiety in social situations
59476,lonely,Sometimes its just a phase or maybe the group of people are not making an effort to make you feel included I am sorry I know how that feels
59477,lonely,Yes but I didnt really fit in with the crowdI couldnt connect with them on anything
59500,sad,Im sorry to hear that what did you decide to do
59501,sad,Yeah that seems like the best thing to do
59502,sad,Well we havent decided to look for a new dog yet I think I need some time to reflect

59745,sad,Yes I had to pick up her carcass and bury her It was heartbreaking
59761,lonely,My friend and I were out at the bars one night doing the usual young people thing They had been acting off a little all night and when I asked if they were okay they told me everything was fine I knew this wasnt true since I had known this person for years but the night came to a close and we got a cab home 
59762,lonely,Im sorry you felt that way Is it any better now
59763,lonely,Well Im glad it worked out well in the end I on the other hand didnt have friends waiting for me home and felt kind of empty
59818,lonely,That sould make me feel sad Did you talk to him about it
59819,lonely,Thats not very nice I think it is just better to be honest even if it might hurt
59820,lonely,Yes I asked him why wasnt I invited he came up with some lame excuse
59821,lonely,That is what I think too  I thought I was his best friend but I guess I was wrong 
60003,lonely,Why not Is everything okay
60004,lonely,That must be somewhat frustrating at times
60005,lonely,Well it is always like this we spend one week together and one apart so he has time to be with his kids 
60074,sad,I am sorry to hear that
60075,sad,It must be very difficult for you Do you have someone you can talk to about it I find that remembering the good times helps you keep their memory alive
60076,sad,Thats great Its nice to have family around that can help pick you up when you feel down
60077,sad,I cant get over it I cry all the time
60078,sad,I try to treasure the memories that we have I keep close to family members as well
60079,sad,Yes family helps me a lot and my father is still alive
60089,sad,Has she had a history of illness
60090,sad,Im sorry to hear that 10 is still very young though so I hope you have plenty of more time to spend with her
60091,sad,Nope shes been very healthy Shes just getting old
60283,lonely,Do you enjoy your alone time or do you wish you had people around
60284,lonely,You totally should call a friend I usually enjoy my alone time also but it is nice to have company around
60285,lonely,I usually enjoy it but today I dont feel like been alone  I guess I should call a friend
60290,sad,How far along do you think you are
60291,sad,Well I want you to know that it WILL be okay I was scared to death when I found out I was pregnant with my first one and it was really hard but everything worked out and he is over 18 now and moved out Also if you decide that you dont want to keep the baby there are lots of options available too
60292,sad,a month and a half I would say
60302,sad,What city are they moving to
60303,sad,That is about as far away as you can move I am sorry to hear that hope everything works out
60304,sad,To Seattle I guess we wont see each other much in the future since I live  in Florida
60459,lonely,Do you miss him
60460,lonely,Be sure to facetime or skype with him That will help with the loneliness 
60461,lonely,I do  Its so quiet without him I cant get used to it
60480,lonely,I hope you feel better soon Maybe you can take a trip out to visit her
60481,lonely,I bet she really misses you How far away did you move
60482,lonely,Oh wow thats really far Well I hope you get to go soon and have a safe trip
60483,lonely,Here soon i plan on it And thank you I am sure she feels the same way
60484,lonely,About 600 miles So ill most likely fly
60499,sad,Thats awful how did your cat die
60500,sad,I understand I have 4 cats myself The oldest is 14
60501,sad,Old age she had a good life but its still tearing me up
60502,sad,Holy Moly thats an old kitty
60784,lonely,Its always an intimidating atmosphere Have you tried joining any clubs
60785,lonely,Right Well Id say try to get to know a few people really well that have common interests
60786,lonely,Yea I joined many clubs but havent really hit it off with anyone yet I just feel so lonely and miss my parents 
60925,sad,That sucks It happens to the best of us At least the computer didnt break
60926,sad,Yeah that would have been an expensive accident Your lucky 
60927,sad,I agree its still functional so I probably shouldnt be too sad
60960,sad,what are you going to do for his birthday
60961,sad,i love birthday gathers
60962,sad,We are going to have a small get together with family

61063,lonely,I am it will be a little lonely around the house
61424,sad,I am so sorry I just recently lost my mother after years of her having alzheimers I wish there was some way I could help you it is such a tough road
61425,sad,You are completely fine needing some time There is nothing fair about something that takes your best friend and turns them into a stranger Be there with her but you have to take time to recharge yourself No one can be strong all the time
61426,sad,Yeah Im not looking forward to going down it Ill just try to carve out as much meaningful time with her as I can I feel selfish sometimes though because there are times when I dont want to be around her because it depresses me how shes changed I need to get over it
61438,lonely,Oh man I bet summer went by quick for you then  Did you have fun together
61439,lonely,Yeah  That sucks you guys are apart now     Id love to do a mountain trip like that though
61440,lonely,Yeah we went to Estes Park in Colorado and hiked at the base of the Rocky Mountains First time I ever saw mountains Pretty cool experience I had to drive the whole way to Colorado though so I can relate to the road trip thing
61444,lonely,Why did you move
61445,lonely,oh well it will come
61446,lonely,A new job
61447,lonely,I hope so I hate this feeling
61470,sad,I hate sayings but the one that goes Tough times dont last but tough people do really applies Life is long You have plenty of time to change your fortune and you seem self aware enough to do it I hope you can work your way back up
61471,sad,Of course but it doesnt really matter what I say or what I think You already knew all that stuff anyway Everyone has to have confidence in themselves Someone elses confidence makes no difference But as long as youre alive youve got a chance
61472,sad,Wow thank you for the kind words I will do my best 0
61541,lonely,Sometimes solitude can be a good thing Were you hoping for company
61542,lonely,Call me next time and I will go with you
61543,lonely,Yeah I hate being by myself  It makes me sad
61551,sad,American football or soccer
61552,sad,Yeah I bet  Are you a Browns fan or something
61553,sad,American Football  When they lose I feel so unhappy
61650,lonely,Ouch I am sorry to hear that

63903,sad,I can appreciate why theyd say that They just want you to feel better But its all about to how youre feeling Youll know in your gut when to get another pet if you ever want to get another one Its important to take the time to reflect on your lost relationship
63904,sad,Thank you very much Yes its always really hard to lose a pet you are so close to My finacee is urging me to get another puppy to help the feeling pass

64127,lonely,Yes but I couldnt go because of work Guess I will have to suck it up and be lonely for a while
64164,lonely,Oh no maybe try going to reddit and ask people what to do in your city
64165,lonely,Hahaha me too its such a time sink This week when it was down for a couple hours I really felt like I had nothing else to browse

64178,sad,Is the kid ok  He wont have his license for a few more years probably now
64179,sad, I do thankfully It was some kid who didnt have a license Im still sad because it was my first car ever 
64190,lonely,Sorry to hear that but why did you distance yourself from your friends
64191,lonely,Good job for realizing that because such people are a bad influence Join some outdoor or interest clubs and you might just find new friends 
64192,lonely,They live a drug culture
64196,lonely,Aww im sorry Maybe enjoy a glass of wine and watch some girly shows My husband is in the military and gone a lot so I feel for you
64197,lonely,Aww thank you means a lot 
64198,lonely,Thank your husband for his service We appreciate him
64232,sad,Oh my sorry to hear that How is he holding up
64233,sad,I am sure it is Just need to give him time and support right now 
64234,sad,Doing okay just a lot to process
64290,sad,That is so sad Dogs become part of the family so when something like that happens it is like losing a family member
64291,sad,I am so sorry for your loss within time you will heal Just try to cherish the memories that you was left with Think about all the good times
64292,sad,It really is  I am just so broken up over it
