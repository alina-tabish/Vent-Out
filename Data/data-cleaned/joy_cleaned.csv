16282,excited,Oh there is  I do eat it now and again but it seems to really screw up my weight loss and digestion so I try never to get near it They have great gluten free alternatives but yep they are all expensive 
16283,excited,Organic helps me a lot as well but unfortunately most things that are gluten free are NOT organic and I am so sensitive to pesticides Trying to find my way around that I am also on Keto low carbSo my diet is hard some days lol

28497,joyful,Absolutely Ive always noticed that phenomena If you act too desperate it actually puts them off On the contrary acting a little disinterested gets THEM more interested
28498,joyful,I can agree with that Women like a man who is dedicated to something It shows good characer

28607,joyful,I wont have a switch but I think that may be worth checking out
28608,joyful,Yup The first one came out when I was in like middle school So its crazy finally getting a character you wanted in the game over 10 years later
28609,joyful,Its like a fighting game but some people call it a party game but basically its a fighting game with all kinds of Nintendo characters You have stuff like Mario Donkey Kong Link Zelda Pikachu etc etc So every time a new game comes out people post online about who they want to see in it next This new game is filled with characters and I think most people will be happy The first game came out in 1999 Time sure flies 
28610,joyful,For sure its definitely worth playing The first game was on the N64 the newest one is going to be on the Switch If you have a Wii U or 3DS theres a Smash game on each of those I love the game I used to play in tournaments with my friends

62828,joyful,I understand  I play every now and again and I usually quit while Im ahead  It always ends up that Im waiting on my friends to lose all their money so we can go home
62829,joyful,Yeah  the first time I went with friends I won 100 bucks but ended up giving it back to the casino  I told myself that if I won money like that again Id just stop and take the money home  It works out well
62830,joyful,I won it at the machine I am not  gambler so I guess it was beginners luck
62831,joyful,I stopped playing I was afraid of losing it all
